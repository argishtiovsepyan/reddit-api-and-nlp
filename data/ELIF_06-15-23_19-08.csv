Most nights I make a concoction of rice and ground turkey. Today the ratio was 1.5 lbs of ground turkey to 2 cups of (unboiled) white rice, which obviously expands to about 3 times it's volume, so equivalently was 6 cups of rice. I didn't eat all of this in one sitting, but it's good for about 2 dinners for me.  
  
I was reading about calories, and the rice has a lot of calories while the turkey somehow has very little. But then the rice is also a carbohydrate? I know these things fundamentally, but now I'm at the point of trying to understand and apply that knowledge.

1686598511.0,ELI5: Why are so many subreddits “going dark”?,"UPDATE: The ELI5 subreddit is back up for business, we're leaving the current sticky here to show why we were read-only the last two days and locking the thread. While the rules, outside of rule 1, were relaxed for this thread, now that the sub is back up all rules are back in force. Thank you for your participation and feedback, we very much appreciate all of our subscribers!

Communities across reddit are going ""dark"", also known as going private, due to concerns about reddit's proposed change in relationship to third-party apps.

**Is Explain Like I'm Five going dark, too?**

We share the frustrations of many other redditors regarding the changes. We have decided to take action to demonstrate our concerns and are suspending normal operations to draw attention to the issue. Specifically, starting on June 12 we will:
    • No longer allow new posts on r/explainlikeimfive
    • Keep this sticky available

**So, you’re not going dark?**

ELI5 is a place to learn. We have decided to focus ELI5 on learning about the controversy — so that users can become informed of this crucial issue and take action or express their opinions.

Private subreddits' public pages have no space to provide detailed explanations, and so we believed it would better fulfill the subreddit’s mission if instead of going fully private, we keep this sticky available and block any new posts.

**How long will this last?**

Some individual subreddits plan to stay dark indefinitely. r/explainlikeimfive doesn't know what the situation will look like in the coming days. Hopefully we will see reddit making meaningful progress to address the concerns that have been raised, and so that's what we're aiming for at this time.

**What is prompting all these concerns?**

We previously posted a sticky with our own version of an ELI5, but subsequently we saw that r/askhistorians did a better job of it, so we’re going to “plagiarize” much of what they wrote here:

On April 18, 2023, Reddit announced it would begin charging for access to its API. Reddit faces real challenges from free access to its API. Reddit data has been used to train large language models that underpin AI technologies, such as ChatGPT and Bard, which matters to us at AskHistorians because technologies like these make it quick and easy to violate our rules on plagiarism, makes it harder for us to moderate, and could erode the trust you have in the information you read here. Further, access to archives that include user-deleted data violates your privacy.

However, make no mistake, we need API access to keep our community running. We use the API in a number of ways, both through direct access and through use of archives of data that were collected using the API, most importantly, Pushshift. For example, we use API supported tools to:
    • Find answers to previously asked questions, including users' answers to questions that were effectively deleted by other users (the question-askers)
    • Monitor the health of the subreddit and track how many questions get answers.
    • Moderate via mobile (when we do)
Admins have promised minimal disruption; however, over the years they’ve made a number of promises to support moderators that they did not, or could not follow up on, and at times even reneged on:
    • In 2015, in response to widespread protests on the sub, the admins promised they would build tools and improve communication with mods.
    • In 2019 the admins promised that chat would always be an opt-in feature. However, a year later an unmoderated chat feature was made a default feature on most subs
    • In 2020, in response to moderators protesting racism on Reddit, admin promised to support mods in combating hate
    • In 2021, again, in response to protests, Reddit’s admin promised a feature to report malicious interference by subreddits promoting Covid denial. Reddit’s admin has certainly made progress. In 2020 they updated the content policy to ban hate and in 2021 they banned and quarantined communities promoting covid denial. But while the company has updated their policies, they have not sufficiently invested in moderation support.

**Reddit admins have had 8 years to build a stronger infrastructure to support moderators but have not.**

API access isn’t just about making life easier for mods. It helps us keep our communities safe by providing important context about users, such as whether or not they have a history of posting rule-violating content or engaging in harmful behavior. The ability to search for removed and deleted data allows moderators to more quickly respond to spam, bigotry, and harassment. On ExplainLikeImFive, we’ve used it to help identify accounts that spam ChatGPT generated content that violates our rules. If we want to mod on our phones, third party apps offer the most robust mod tools. Further, third party apps are particularly important for moderators and users who rely on screen readers, as the official Reddit app is inaccessible to Blind individuals. Mods need API access because Reddit doesn’t support their needs. We are highly concerned about the downstream impacts of this decision. Reddit is built on volunteer moderation labor that costs other companies millions of dollars per year. While some tools we rely on may not be technically impacted, and some may return after successful negotiations, the ecosystem of API supported tools is vast and varied, and the tools themselves require volunteer labour to maintain. Changes like these, particularly the poor communication surrounding them, and cobbled responses as domino after domino falls, year after year, risk making r/ExplainLikeImFive a worse place both for moderators and for users—there will likely be more spam, fewer posts helpfully directing users to previous answers to their questions, and our ability to effectively address trolling, and JAQing off will slow down.

Without the moderators who develop, nurture, and protect Reddit’s diverse communities, Reddit risks losing what makes it so special. We love what we do here at ExplainLikeI’mFive.

A third party app is just another way you can read and post to reddit. Before reddit had its own app for your phone, there were other apps that let you read, post and comment. These apps use something called the API ELI5:How does an API Work?. Reddit's API lets your computer or phone get posts and comments without having to use a web browser or the official app. Apps such as Reddit is Fun, Slide, Comet, Boost, or Apollo then take what the API gives them and displays it. Apps like this allow you to customize your reddit experience by changing a theme, or changing how you upvote a post. While those are just two very small examples, you can begin to understand why people like these apps. Have you ever gotten mad at the reddit app because it had bugs, or it was just weird about how it did something? Right now, and until July 1st, you have the option to try out one of these apps and see if you like reddit better this way. After July 1st, you won't have the option anymore. If reddit's app has a bad bug, and you can't read posts for half a day, you will no longer be able to pull up a second option on your phone, or a third option, or a fourth...

**What are the next steps, and how long will all this last?**

We’re not sure. It depends on how the broader conversation goes. As you might imagine, there are a variety of views among our moderator team. But in general, our views are, again, similar to those on r/askhistorians:
We understand Reddit’s need to change and evolve. For all we may harp on Reddit’s flaws, we do want to see it succeed! After all, we wouldn’t exist without it. So, if we’re expecting Reddit leadership to listen to us, we should be willing to work with them. In the days following the publication of the post, we discussed as a team what the specifics of working with Reddit would look like so we could clearly articulate it to you. Compromise means something along the lines of:

* Updates to the API are not tied to a particular date but are, instead, rolled out once the roadmap shared here is successfully achieved.
* Accessibility tools such as screen readers are part of the native Reddit infrastructure.
* Updates are made across Android and iOS.

We think slowing down is the right thing to do. It would minimize further disruption while also generating an income stream for Reddit.

WHY on the bottom part of the equation am I subtracting the growth rate from the expected rate of return? The words “that is the effective discounting factor” mean nothing to me. I understand the “time value of money” concept (and suspect it has something to do with this); I do not understand how these two *particular* factors are the ones you need (to be divided by dividend price of course) to help determine the stock’s appropriate pricing. 

What do those two amounts have to do with anything? Please help!

I was assuming the correctness of maxwells equations, how flux remains same in the absence of additional charge. So is it to say that that is 100% correct or just simple it can be a really really good approximation and we dont know?

Edit 2:
The best explanation I got till now: We simply do not know if it is really 1/r^2, but experimentally we have found that this model is very accurate to several decimal points(2.0000...). The 1/r^2 and maxwells equations are same, they are correct or wrong together. And in my opinion, the divergence equation for electric field seems very simple, and we found its high accuracy through experiments, so I have a feeling that it must all be exact 1/r^2. But still, I don't think we have a way to find out because the equations are themselves the starting point which describes the experiments very well, we don't have derivation for them and I don't think we will ever have, and on the other hand, our only way to check is by experiments which won't give 100% confidence accuracy.

Edit 3:
Another perception is about unit-dimentions. Like ( c^2 ) * e0*u0 = 1, which binds the units of e0 and u0, so electric and magnetic formulas must together be right or wrong. I can't think or anything more right now, but there can be some other unit-dimension constraints that I am missing which will complete the picture.",0.83,83

1686319279.0,"eli5: Why do we use force to determine at what point an object breaks, not pressure?","Everywhere I look people describe the breakpoint of things like bones in a quantity of force (discovery channel states it takes 4000N to break a human femur for example).

Ruling out things like angle, whether you're hitting the femur long ways or at the end, etc. by assuming everything but area is constant: If you took a mallet and hit a femur with 3500N of force somehow, it should not break according to the above. If you then had the end of the mallet sharpened to be a fine (but sturdy) tip, and hit with the same 3500N (assume the sharpening does not adjust the mass, same acceleration) why would it not then break? And if it does break then the pressure is actually what matters to a breakpoint, right?

By concentrating the force to a smaller area, that area is receiving a greater proportion of the overall force and thus more easily reaches whatever breakpoint the material has, right?

Another way I thought about it is, yes increasing a force enough will eventually break something, but the simple act of increasing a force without changing the area also increases the pressure.

1686243935.0,eli5: A Prioritisation vs An Optimisation Model.,"I might be beating myself up over nothing here, but I am trying to pin down the difference between a model that optimises a set of decisions and one that prioritises them; this is specifically concerning linear optimisation problems. 

The example I have in my head is of the optimisation problem involving filling a bag with gems of different sizes and values. The bag only has a finite volume, and so you need to choose the combination of gems that maximises the value.

One option is to take rank the gems in terms of value per unit size and then take the highest-ranked stones until you don't have any more room, but you might waste space. In my head, this is a prioritisation, not an optimisation. 

However, a combination of lower-ranked stones might fill the space perfectly, resulting in an overall higher value. This would be an example of what I would consider an optimisation. 

Is this difference important in practice? Is there a better way to actually explain the difference between them? 

Final question, if all the rocks are the same size, is there a difference between prioritisation and optimisation anymore? The results of either would be the same, but are the methods of getting there still distinct?

1686242390.0,"ELI5: How is star distance, brightness and mass calculated/measured?","Hey. Tried searching for this but was unsuccessful.

Now, to preface this, I know absolutely nothing about science. I've watched a few documentaries, but that's as far as my knowledge goes.

I have been wondering about something for a while but whenever I try looking it up, the answers are far too complex for me to understand.

So my question revolves around stars. First, how is distance to stars measured? How do we know that it is reasonably accurate, and not a situation where said star was smaller and closer or bigger and farther away than previously thought?

Second, how is the brightness measured? I've heard stuff like ""this and that star shines 100x brighter than our sun"". How can that be reasonably accurately measured over the vast distances we're talking about in space? 

Third, how can we measure or calculate mass of a star, given the vast distances? 

I suspect those 3 questions might be somewhat linked, so I thought I'd ask all 3 in the same thread.

Now keep in mind, I do not understand calculus or math above algebra, so if anything like that is needed to understand, please dumb it down as much as you reasonably can.

Getting fats, carbs, and protein is simple enough, along with general recommendations on supplementation like using powdered whey. 

The real confusion are when it comes to supplementation, and everyone seems to disagree. For example, I was personally told to avoid whey isolate as it's apparently mostly not absorbed with other foods, or not utilized after having 40 grams worth of protein. On the other hand, I've heard of no such limit on eating chicken breast or pork loin. I still do use it, but seeing similar sentiments on other supplements makes this worse: I eat Vitamin D3, Zinc, and a generic multivitamin but apparently since my multivitamin was pill form it wasn't utilized (told this by GP). I then got the gummy form of all 3 supplements but it's impossible to know how it makes a difference. For reference, my new GP says the pill forms are 'better'.

What made me think of this was learning that ""fortified"" cereals and other breakfast meals, despite advertising, say, iron as a nutrient in the food actually provide no available iron...

I can't grasp what it represents in the real world

Addition/Subtraction: only makes sense in same units and increases/decreases the value like moving forwards/backwards or inreasing/decreasing the amount of force on an object etc...

Division: a ratio, how much of x per y: how many meters you move in one second, how much force is put on an area etc....

Multiplication: no idea. The unit of force: kg / m×s^(2,) mass per whatever  m×s^(2) means or F = m×g what does m\*g represent? Obviously there is a mathematical proof for this equation but what is the actual reason beyond: the math works out

Or imagine I am in the process of figuring out a brand new equation (in Physics/Chemistry/Geometry/...) how do I know that I need a multiplication right here beyond it's the math?

**EDIT:** An Attempt to clarify the problem I have

At some point in school we learn that multiplication can describe areas: 7\*5 = 35 is the number of pieces in a rectangle  if said rectangle is divisible into 7  rows with 5 pieces each or 7 columns with 5 pieces each or the opposite.  
Multiplication can also describe an event occuring multiple times if I run 5 km in 7 hours then I ran 35 km total  
in probability multiplication can also describe the number of possible uniqe iteration  
and I definitly forgot a few things. 

But what does Multiplication describe in nature sciences or physics especially? Perhaps in the example of F = m\*g but also in general",0.22,11

1686066788.0,"ELI5: Why are subreddits ""going dark""?","Communities across reddit are going ""dark"", also known as going private, due to concerns about reddit's proposed change in relationship to third-party apps.

**Wait, if I'm reading this, why isn't Explain Like I'm Five going dark, too?**

We share the frustrations of many other communities across reddit regarding the new policy changes and we are also suspending normal operations to draw attention to the same issue.  To do this — while also fulfilling our educational mission to users — we **are** doing two things:

- Posting this stickied discussion post

- **Starting June 12th** - Preventing new posts to the subreddit

ELI5 is, after all, a place to learn. We have decided to focus ELI5 on learning about the controversy — so that users can become informed of this crucial issue and take action or express their opinions. (Private subreddits' public pages have no space to provide detailed explanations.)

**Ok now that that's out of the way, what is all this about?**

A third party app is just another way you can read and post to reddit.  Before reddit had its own app for your phone, there were other apps that let you read, post and comment.  These apps use something called the API ([ELI5:How does an API Work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/10rnu6s/eli5_how_does_an_api_work/)).  Reddit's API lets your computer or phone get posts and comments without having to use a web browser or the official app.    

Apps such as Reddit is Fun, Slide, Comet, Boost, or yes Apollo then take what the API gives them and displays it.  Apps like this allow you to customize your reddit experience by changing a theme, or changing how you upvote a post.  While those are just two very small examples, you can begin to understand why people like these apps.  

Have you ever gotten mad at the reddit app because it had bugs, or it was just weird about how it did something? Right now, and until July 1st, you have the option to try out one of these apps and see if you like reddit better this way.  After July 1st, you won't have the option anymore.  If reddit's app has a bad bug, and you can't read posts for half a day, you will no longer be able to pull up a second option on your phone, or a third option, or a fourth...

I think you can see where this is going.  But here's the thing about it:

Reddit didn't tell all the apps they can't get on reddit anymore, **they set a price so high no app can afford it.** When one of the biggest apps asked why his price was going to be so high, reddit's official reply was ""[**Figure it out on your own.**""](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13z1kl2/apollo_dev_asks_how_app_is_overusing_apis_reddit/). 

Third Party Apps or TPAs have been on reddit for a decade.  Reddit gave them 30 days notice of the introduction of a pricing structure set so high no one can afford it.

Reddit has said that they don't want to shut down apps, but their actions speak much louder than their words.  It's hard not to draw the conclusion they want them gone.  

**That is just not how you treat your friends.**

Every app developer has said they will have to shut their app down.  And the visually impaired on reddit have said they will close down [their subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) because the app on iOS doesn't allow them to even see reddit.

**Why should I care?  I use the official app.**

Well for one thing you *might* care one day, but you won't have that option any longer, because reddit is **removing user choice**.  

People who love reddit so much they seek out another app for it submit a lot of good posts to reddit that you read.  What if these good posters all leave the site?  What if half of them leave?  Are you cool with less content to upvote? 

What if reddit does something else like pump tons of ads at you-- way more than now -- and you want to try out one of those apps you saw when you first downloaded the official app.  You simply won't be able to anymore.

But even if you still don't care, don't you think user choice is generally a good thing?  What will they get rid of next?

Also, NSFW content is in danger, and can no longer be accessed through the API which is going to make it harder to find spammers.

**What can I do?**

Make a meme and post it.  Make tiktoks. Contact the admins.  Tweet it.  Fill up the front page about it on reddit.  Ask others to do the same.  

Reddit needs to understand that decisions like this have long term unintended consequences.  They can and should make money from third party apps.  That is reasonable.  But when you go from free for over a decade to a [$20 million fee for one year](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/reddits-api-pricing-results-in-shocking-20-million-a-year-bill-for-apollo/), with 30 days notice, something's not right.

When it came time for staging and dropping the first stage, we can clearly see cutoff of rocket motors, separation and ignition of the second stage.

One thing that puzzled me always was the first stage as it falls away is seen trailing vapor, residue from its shut off engines.  This reasonably has to be residual unburned oxidizer/propellant.  its enough of a plume to be visible even 30+ seconds later it is still leaking away as the second stage carries the rocket further away and away.

Im asking bc every ounce, every bit of weight is calculated for and certainly fuel is no exception.  Why lug the fuel up there just to shut the engines off presumably early and not burn it.  Any reason for this inefficiency?

In every visualization and video you always see a big pool filled with deuterium and 10-ish meter below the surface there is the reactor. Uranium rods filled with uranium atoms that are being shot by free neutrons, creating new atoms and even more free neutrons = heat. 

But the big pool of Deuterium never boils, nor have I ever seen a significant amount of steam coming out of it.

Edit: By explaining simply, I mean very very simply, like the link below, in an analogy, not using any financial terms. I am not a finance student.

Now, to preface this, I know absolutely nothing about science. I've watched a few documentaries, but that's as far as my knowledge goes.

I have been wondering about something for a while but whenever I try looking it up, the answers are far too complex for me to understand.

So my question revolves around stars. First, how is distance to stars measured? How do we know that it is reasonably accurate, and not a situation where said star was smaller and closer or bigger and farther away than previously thought?

Second, how is the brightness measured? I've heard stuff like ""this and that star shines 100x brighter than our sun"". How can that be reasonably accurately measured over the vast distances we're talking about in space? 

Third, how can we measure or calculate mass of a star, given the vast distances? 

I suspect those 3 questions might be somewhat linked, so I thought I'd ask all 3 in the same thread.

Now keep in mind, I do not understand calculus or math above algebra, so if anything like that is needed to understand, please dumb it down as much as you reasonably can.

Getting fats, carbs, and protein is simple enough, along with general recommendations on supplementation like using powdered whey. 

The real confusion are when it comes to supplementation, and everyone seems to disagree. For example, I was personally told to avoid whey isolate as it's apparently mostly not absorbed with other foods, or not utilized after having 40 grams worth of protein. On the other hand, I've heard of no such limit on eating chicken breast or pork loin. I still do use it, but seeing similar sentiments on other supplements makes this worse: I eat Vitamin D3, Zinc, and a generic multivitamin but apparently since my multivitamin was pill form it wasn't utilized (told this by GP). I then got the gummy form of all 3 supplements but it's impossible to know how it makes a difference. For reference, my new GP says the pill forms are 'better'.

Division: a ratio, how much of x per y: how many meters you move in one second, how much force is put on an area etc....

Multiplication: no idea. The unit of force: kg / m×s^(2,) mass per whatever  m×s^(2) means or F = m×g what does m\*g represent? Obviously there is a mathematical proof for this equation but what is the actual reason beyond: the math works out

Or imagine I am in the process of figuring out a brand new equation (in Physics/Chemistry/Geometry/...) how do I know that I need a multiplication right here beyond it's the math?

**EDIT:** An Attempt to clarify the problem I have

At some point in school we learn that multiplication can describe areas: 7\*5 = 35 is the number of pieces in a rectangle  if said rectangle is divisible into 7  rows with 5 pieces each or 7 columns with 5 pieces each or the opposite.  
Multiplication can also describe an event occuring multiple times if I run 5 km in 7 hours then I ran 35 km total  
in probability multiplication can also describe the number of possible uniqe iteration

We have come to learn some very sad news recently, u/bossgalaga, the founder of r/Explainlikeimfive, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:

[The Immune Deficiency Foundation](https://primaryimmune.org/waystogive)

[The Institute for Effective Education](https://www.tiee.org/about/)

We are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.

Additionally, it has come to our attention that u/bossgalaga made a post in /r/askreddit on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, ""...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored."" This, of course, led to the start of r/explainlikeimfive. If you're interested in reading that post, [you can do so here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)

Given the seriousness of this issue, we are joining other subreddits in asking for Reddit's administration to explain their justification for hiring her. We would also like to see her removed, as we feel that her employment with Reddit stands against the values that Reddit users believe in.

I’m realizing my question is actually more specifically “Why does 2° matter so much when the temperature outside varies by far more than that every afternoon?”

I understand that it has impacts with the ocean and butterfly effects. I’m just not quite understanding *how* it’s so devastating, when 2° seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I’d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts. 

It’s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon. 

And no, I’m not a climate change denier. I’m trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.

**Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3**
I need to go to sleep. I wasn’t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I’ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning. 

Main things I’ve learned, based on Redditors’ comments, for those just joining:

* **Average global temp** is neither *local weather outside*, nor is it *weather on a particular day*. It is the *average weather for the year across the globe.* Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2° warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can’t handle 2° warmer *average global weather.* They are not the same. For context, [here is an XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1732/) explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4° less than it is today. The ""little ice age"" was just ~1-2° colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.

* While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of *average global temp*, since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. **This is what was confusing me.**

* The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem. 

* Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could’ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected). 

* The change in global average (not 2° local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.

* The issue is not the 2° warmer temp. It is that those 2° could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2° difference can quickly become 20°. The 2° may be our event horizon. 

* Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I’m being told that [higher C02 is *better* for plants](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth), and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I’m still unclear on the details here.]

* A major part of the issue is the timing. It’s not just that it’s happening, it’s that it’s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There’s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions. 

* We don’t actually know exactly what will happen because it’s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.",0.87,1336

Edit 2: To elaborate. Many are saying things like time is a constant and cannot slow, and while that might be true, for the layman, the question being truly asked is how does gravity have an affect on how time is perceived, and of course, all the shenanigans that come with such phenomena.

I would also like to say, as much as I, and others, appreciate the answers and discussion happening, keep in mind that the goal is to explain a concept simply, however possible, right?

I play WoW and Final Fantasy XIV. Recently I've been in areas where hundreds if not thousands of players are in the same area in the game world. Client-side computer graphics/processing capacity aside, how come servers seem to chug/have lots of lag when everyone is one place, aside from that same amount of people being spread out across the game world?

>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a **pseudo-Riemannian manifold** *M*, endowed with a **metric tensor** and governed by geometrical laws. (ii) Over *M* is a **vector bundle** *X* with a **non-abelian gauge group** *G*. (iii) **Fermions** are sections of **(Ŝ +⊗VR)⊕(Ŝ ⊗VR¯)(Ŝ+⊗VR)⊕(Ŝ⊗VR¯)**. ***R*** and ***R*****¯** are not **isomorphic**; their failure to be **isomorphic** explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in representation difference Δ in some underlying theory. All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the **metric tensor**, the **gauge fields**, and the **fermions** are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.  
>  
>Edward Witten, ""Physics and Geometry""

According to Eric Weinstein (who I know is a controversial figure, but let's leave that aside for now), this is the most beautiful and important paragraph written in the English language. You can watch him talk about it [here](https://youtu.be/vdW9XDBuxjU?t=3079) or take a deep dive into his [Wiki](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Graph,_Wall,_Tome).

Could someone (1) literally translate the paragraph so a layman can grasp the gist of it, switching the specific jargon **in bold** with simplified plain English translations? Just assume I have no formal education in math or physics, so feel free to edit the flow of the paragraph for clarity's sake. For example, something like:

>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a ~~pseudo-Riemannian manifold~~ ***flexible*** ***3-dimension space*** *M*, endowed with a ~~metric tensor~~ **composite list of contingent quantities** and governed by geometrical laws... etc.

Fact 1) Due to Hawking radiation black holes don't exist forever.
Fact 2) If you fall into a black hole backwards you'll see the universe accelerate as you approach, and an infinite amount of time will transpire before you cross the event horizon.

Conclusion, the black hole no longer exists as you cross the event horizon.

Edit: I'm marking this explained with the following link because experts seem to agree this is in fact what's going on (http://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/bh_pub_faq.html#forever).

However, I stubbornly think a clock approaching a black hole will continue to slow relative to its synced partner left behind, and in the hour or so it takes to hit the event horizon (in proper time) the black hole, relative to the watch left behind, will have evaporated, so nothing ever reaches, let alone crosses, the event horizon.

While we share many of the same frustrations that many other default subreddits have (namely, lack of communication and tools from the administrators to effectively moderate) this subreddit is, first and foremost, a place to learn.  We may not always achieve that goal, but we always try.

After significant internal discussion, we have come to the conclusion that our moral support for our fellow moderators does not overwhelm that goal. 

Do not take this to mean that we, as a team, are satisfied with the current status quo. Reddit, as an organization, has prioritized gimmicks (redditmade, snoovitars, redditnotes, etc) above creating better moderation tools, opening up lines of communication, etc, and this has not been to the advantage of the community as a whole.

While the specifics of the various moderation team complaints vary, the reality of the situation is that the discontent exists and is not addressed by the administration of this website.  If you are curious why a specific subreddit has shut down, we recommend visiting that subreddit and asking them.

OK so we have some initial taint which depending on where you're coming from is cause enough for damnation in of itself or simply a tendency towards sin. 

.

fast forward some years and god (arbitrarily?) allows Mary to be born without this sin (immaculate conception). dunnow how that was achieved or why, maybe he was planning ahead and needed a clean vessel for the birth of his son. at any rate she got a ""get out of ancestral sins free""card.

.

later J-Bomb is born, as God's son incarnate. now presumably he is completely human (though able to perform miracles?) and physically representative of the perfection that Adam and Eve lost (2nd Adam in a sense) 

he goes bout his time preachin the good stuff and generally being all Jesus .  the local government says ""fuck that new age religious noise"" and has him executed. 

and... now i'm lost. why did his execution pay for anything? in what way did that make up for our original sin?  i mean if i was God and I bothered to send a messenger, my ""Son"" no less and some people fuckin' killed him i wouldn't be all ""that's great now i forgive you "" I'd be more &#3232;\_&#3232;

I commute to work via bus and, every day, hordes of elderly Chinese men and women push and shove their way onto the bus in front of me. Usually I've waited a half hour, by myself, for the bus. At the last possible minute, a flood of geriatric Chinese men and women outflank me, ignoring my patient resolve as the first in line. I stand agape as they elbow their way in front of me--dragging their wheeled baskets over my toes. Once on the bus, their behavior continues to mystify: they run to fill the best seats; however, once those are full, they stand around the doors, refusing to budge for people entering or exiting the bus. When I shove my way past them--mirroring their own behavior--they complain loudly. I see ""gweilo"" in their beady, little eyes when they moan and cry out in mock pain as I push my way past their unmoving bodies so that I can get off the damn bus before I'm swept along to Chinatown with them.

I think these people are horrible, so, clearly, I'm lacking some cultural empathy. Will someone please Explain to Me Like I'm 5 why elderly Chinese people act this way.

My theories:

1. Cities in China are massively overpopulated. The only way to guarantee oneself resources is to be pushy and horrible. Elderly Chinese immigrants bring these habits to other countries.

2. ?

3. Old Chinese people are just fucking, stupid assholes. I should treat them as such. Instead of tiptoeing around them and feeling bad, I should scream and slap them into submission--because that's the treatment they're expecting.

**I don't understand why it's okay for a woman to get intoxicated, make some bad decisions, and then pretend to be a victim?**



[For instance](http://slutwalkberlin.de/post/9664255676/my-rapist-doesnt-know-hes-a-rapist-you-taught), this picture caused quite the commotion. From what I'm reading, she went to party and had drunk sex with a guy she was drunk flirting with, while she was in what seems to have been a monogamous relationship. She was left in a parking garage staircase, because that's probably where she went to go fuck this guy that she knew nothing about. He doesn't have to baby-sit her just because they had sex. Her friends gave her dirty looks because she cheated on her boyfriend while she was drunk, then claimed rape. **I don't know the full story, but this is usually how it happens: bitches get drunk, and they get horny. Maybe I'm too harsh. IDK, but can someone PLEASE explain to me why she is a victim? I truly do not understand. This isn't sarcasm, or trolling. I'm very serious.**




[Now, in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/pl54h/i_was_accused_of_rape_last_year_and_just_got/) everyone's calling this guy a rapist. From what I've read, she never said no, but she resisted while he pulled off her tights. I DO THIS WITH MY BF ALL THE TIME. Is he raping me? I think it's sexy.


**I know there are some cases of ACTUAL drunk rape, where the woman is COMPLETELY unconscious, unable to speak, stand, open their eyes, or even move.**


But, this isn't the case *most* of the time. Most of the time, the woman irresponsibly drinks herself into blackout mode. How can you determine if someone else is making memories? You can't. There's a legal drinking age, and constant reminders to drink responsibly for a reason. 

Sounds like buyer's remorse to me.

Europeans sometimes have common traits that allow us to take a good guess at what ethnicity they might originate from. For example, a Jewish person CAN (not always) have fairly distinct features. Things like red hair, etc.

Black people in America, it seems, can have these traits. Africa is a huge area, and black people can look greatly diverse. Sometimes you'll notice similar traits across a percentage of black people, usually facially. It just seems like they may originate from the same areas, or maybe I'm crazy.

**Also: I'm not a racist**


I understand the socio-political reasons that make it controversial and taboo to speak about races and compare races, but I still feel like it's a honest inquiry to actually ask the question and I think it's valid one that should be legal to ask: are some races superior to others in terms of IQ ?

We all know the genetic mutations that is the cause of the difference in our melanin production (skin color/hair color), eye color, facial structure differences, height, muscle mass etc. So why is the brain so different?

The ashkenazi jews represent 3% of the US populations and 0.2% of the world population, yet they make up 27% of all Nobel prize winners.

To me it seems inevitable that certain groups of humans would face certain obstacles in their evolutionary path that selected for higher intelligence..

So doesn't it just make perfect sense that certain races are infact superior to other races when it comes to raw brain power?

I'm not advocating that this makes them worth more than any other races, but please ELI5 why I'm wrong about that.

If I can't do that, I'll have to drive to another station in another town and do so. Anyway, From what I can tell from this schedule, if I take the train in from Bay Street, I will have to transfer over in Newark, is that correct?

It is even more infuriating when they preface the quote with something like: ""Regardless of what you believe, the Bible says...x"". Umm...what?

**EDIT:**   
It was very rewarding for me to read all of your comments. Thank you most kindly for enlightening me.

For those interested in the cause of my previous confusion:   
The gaps in my understanding of going from y\*x=z to y=z/x were definitions of the equal sign and division. 

I can see now that I previously considered the = sign to mean «result» or «answer» in some sort of final sense, like a conclusion; I now see that it only states that this is equal to that.

Following this fundamental piece of knowledge, I can belatedly understand what an equation is. From there, via the definition of division as the opposite of multiplication, I can see that if I divide something while also multiplying it with the same number, these actions cancel each other out.

And so the magical spell between y\*x=z and y=z/x is the logic above expressed mathematically as x/(y\*x)=z/x.",0.61,53
