1686855114.0,Is it possible that Pi repeats at some point?,"When I say ""repeat"", I'm not saying that Pi eventually becomes an endless string of ""999"" or ""454545"". What I'm asking is: it is possible at some point that Pi repeats entirely? Let's say theoretically, 10 quadrillion digits into Pi the pattern ""31415926535..."" appears again and continues for another 10 quadrillion digits until it repeats again. This would make Pi a continuous 10 quadrillion digit long pattern, but a repeating number none the less. 

My understanding of math is not advanced and I'm having a hard time finding an answer to this exact question. My idea is that an infinite string of numbers must repeat at some point. Is this idea possible or not? Is there a way to prove or disprove this?",0.74,53
1686858967.0,Is the speed of light relative to the observer? How does travel in space work?,"Physics questions related to the speed of light and space travel

I am having difficulty finding answers to a few related questions regarding the speed of light and velocities in space:

Is there a maximum velocity if you have infinite fuel?

Person A measures the speed of light while on earth as ~298,000 km/s. Person B is traveling past earth at half the speed of light. Does person B measure the speed of light at ~149,000 km/s, or 298,000 km/s?

How is speed measured in space if all points of reference are also in constant motion? (Rather than fixed points of reference like here on earth). 

I know these seem like simple Q's, but I think there is more to them than an initial glance may suggest.

Looking forward to the ensuing discussion!",0.68,25

1686762826.0,How does Mercury's orbit prove Einstein's theory of Gravitational Relativity?,"Hello! Complete science dunce here. I tried to find an article explaining but they all use terms I don't understand, so I figured I would come to ask people who know what they are talking about for a more helpful answer. 

I am reading one of Stephen Hawking's books and, as a complete airhead when it comes to physics and science I am struggling with the concepts. I turned to a youtube video to try and figure out what gravitational relativity was. I think I grasp most of it from the explanation and diagrams, but the one thing I can't wrap my head around is the section on Mercury.

It is said that the precession of Mercury proved Einstein's curved space theory using the equation. Now, obviously, the equation is complete nonsense to me and so that could be why I can't see the connection, but if it's something physical ('the curvature does xyz to Mercury which causes the precession!' etc) then please could someone explain?

TL;DR: Please explain how the unusual orbit of Mercury proves Einstein's curvature theory, but do it as though you're talking to an idiot.

1686543618.0,AskScience’s concerns regarding Reddit’s API changes,"In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddit’s promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddit’s past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

Therefore, we have decided to join the protest beginning June 12. During this time, askscience will not be allowing new posts.  We anticipate being offline for 48 hours, and we thank you sincerely for your support and understanding.",0.89,1

1686477635.0,Does our changing position in the galaxy have similar effects to our changing position around the sun?,"As we know, our planets orbit of the sun and the angle in which it rotates has an impact on our atmosphere which is why we have seasons. And every 365 days or so we pass through the four seasons.

So if we look at that in a wider scale and look at our solar system. We’ll see that our solar system is orbiting the centre of the galaxy and it takes approximately 230 million years for our solar system to complete 1 full orbit.

My question is that do we potentially pass through some parts of the galaxy that have a positive or negative effect on our climate during those 230 million years? I find it hard to believe that we can orbit our sun (which is comparison to the galaxy is a tiny ball of fire) and have huge impacts on weather and growth etc. Yet being in a different point in the galaxy would have zero impact.

1686319503.0,Why is the sky blue? Do I understand it correctly:,"I’ve been trying to understand why the sky changes colors, and I think I understand most of it, but something in the online explanations doesn’t make it clear for me:

I’ve read:

- sky is blue because blue light gets scattered the most during the day. 

- in the evening it turns red because now even more of the blue light gets scattered

So a few questions:

1. The scattering of light during the day: does it mean that blue light gets reflected off air particles and reaches our eyes, while the rest of the frequencies pass through and reach the ground?

2. Surely some of the other frequencies also get scattered during the day, just in much smaller amounts?

3. So during the evening blue light gets scattered even more, to the point where even less of it reaches the eyes?

4. And so it gets red because now we can see the lower frequencies being scattered without blue overshadowing them?

5. Trying to word it myself: during the day only the highest frequencies get filtered, but during the evening also lower frequencies get filtered, because now the “light strainer” (air) is just catching more of it?

6. It gets darker in the evening without a good ability to see colors because there’s is no blue and so on light to reflect off of objects?

7. Is it ok to speak about light as a frequency? Or it’s only correct to say “wave length”?",0.85,167

1686218851.0,"How exactly does ""stability"" work in analytical anion groups from qualitative analysis?","(Just a heads up, I'm painfully aware of how obnoxiously long this is, Sorry about that!)

What exactly does stability of the group reagent (dil HCl, conc H2SO4, BaCl2, etc..) mean in this context?

To quote my textbook exactly (this is highschool-level chem by the way, but feel free to add more details as long as the explanation itself has that in mind): ""Hydrochloric acid is **more stable** than the acids from which the group anions are derived, so when it reacts with these anions salts, it replaces the less stable acids which are easy to volatilize or decompose in the form of gases which can be detected by suitable reagents ""

Is it an inherent property of any reagent in isolation, which is then compared to the required anions' acids (at least for groups whose reagent is an acid) to determine the suitable reagent for each group (As in Kc of the reagent and the produced acid are orders of magnitudes apart that the reagent's anions are undetectable?, but that wouldn't really make sense considering HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids dissociation-wise), So if all we cared about was that the reagents don't dissociate much relative to the products (ppt./volatile gas), considering strong acids would be borderline stupid.

Is it a property that is fundementally dependent on the ions in question, as in that it's defined as being ""with respect to"" said anion rather than ""more stable _than_"" it in some universal sense?
(At least for when the group reagent is a specific salt (BaCl2, for example), is it that the salt's cation really ""wants"" to bond with its group anions, beacuse that chemical releases a significant amount energy when formed which is what stability normally means, but then again, what about strong acids?)

Is it more nuanced than this? Is it a blend of these views? 

Also is it different depending on whether the reagent is an acid, a salt, an acidified other type of chemical, or something else? I mean, they are different chemicals and it would make sense that they get different treatments when deciding what reagent works for what, but then again, I have no idea what stability means *in this context* so I'm probably being unnecessarily verbose because I'm missing something pretty simple.

Bonus Question: Why do we use **Dilute** HCl in one group, but **Concentrated** H2SO4 in another? Is it because conc H2SO4 prevents haloacids from dissolving, rather than evolving to be detected, when detecting halogen ions?",0.88,1

Is there anything inherent about DNA that ensures mutations occur so that evolution can occur as well? Did DNA itself evolve (for lack of a better word) in a way so that it produced mutations because that was somehow beneficial to its own survival? Or is it all truly spontaneous?

If a = v-v0/t (acceleration formula) and you throw a tennis ball in space, the starting velocity is the same as the end velocity due to no air resistance (object in motion stays in motion). Because then numerator will always = 0 so no acceleration.  

And if not, then the ball would surely fall back to earth. And if that’s true, wouldn’t humans also float towards earth away from the ISS on a spacewalk?  

And gravity is still present even at the ISS. Satellites use fuel to stay in orbit (yet the moon seemingly orbits earth in a way where gravity is not pulling it closer essentially in a perfect way which IMO proves godlike or spiritual influence on literal matter for it to be there over 1000s of years), so how is a human on a spacewalk not being dragged by their tether and instead it looks as if they move with it.

Ask us your burning questions about using science to predict, prevent, and put out wildfires!","Hi Reddit! We're Ruby Leung, Mark Wigmosta, and Andre Coleman from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). We're here today to discuss [our scientific approach to tackling wildfires](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/taming-tomorrows-wildfires), an issue that has become increasingly prominent, particularly in the Western United States.

As the wildfire seasons seem to extend and intensify each year, our team and fellow researchers are diligently working on predicting, preventing, and mitigating these disasters. From predicting the occurrence and direction of big blazes to implementing strategies to prevent future fires, our team is leveraging a broad spectrum of scientific perspectives to combat wildfires.

One of our tools, [the RADR-Fire satellite system](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/rapid-analytics-disaster-response), led by Andre Coleman, helps firefighting personnel, utilities operators, and other decision makers better understand a fire's behavior so they can make informed choices in the midst of natural disaster. It also aids utility operators assess risk by identifying areas prone to wildfire and which energy infrastructure needs protection.

On the preventative side, Mark Wigmosta and team have developed a new tool with the U.S. Forest Service to determine where controlled burns or thinning would be most effective in reducing fire hazards. Such measures have been found to potentially reduce fire hazards by 25-96 percent in certain cases, and also yield benefits like reduced smoke and increased streamflow.

Meanwhile, Ruby Leung is leading a team in creating models that consider an expanded list of ""wildfire predictors,"" delivering a more complete picture of how likely it is that a fire strikes, how far it burns, and how much smoke it releases into the atmosphere.

Our collective work is helping us get an edge on tomorrow's wildfires, making utilities more resilient to natural disasters, and increasing our understanding of fire behavior in response to climate change. We're here today to discuss our research, the scientific principles behind it, and how we see it impacting the future of wildfire management.

We'll be on at **8am pacific (11 AM ET, 15 UT)**, ask us anything!

I was thinking about this while looking at a lightning strike that curved quite weirdly, and struck something that really didn't seem like the most optimal point. I had never really thought to look deeper into how it, and the whole ""path of least resistance"" thing worked and accepted that statement at face value. While thinking about how it would work, I tried to picture the below experiment in my head, but couldn't quite make sense of it. I don't have the means to actually do it myself, but I'm still burningly curious and google has not helped.  


Two long rods of different conductive materials are connected in the middle of their length by a strip of a third conductive material. One of the two rods is made of a material with ""medium"" conductivity, while the other is substantially more conductive. The strip in the middle is still conductive but is much poorer at it than either of the other two. Attached to the ""medium"" conductivity rod is a source of electricity. For instance a Car Battery.   


How would electricity flow in this situation? Would it follow the ""medium"" rod to it's end, ignoring the bridge over? Personally I am not sure if it would be able to realize that there is a potentially ""better"" path for it on the other side of this obstacle, obviously since there is no intelligence to it. But would it do so if the other side is ""worth it"" anyways? Or would it spread throughout the entire device like a liquid through a series of tubes, only being slowed down not stopped entirely by the resistive bridge?  


If it does flow only or primarily down the ""worse"" path because a seemingly terrible obstacle is all it can ""see"", the situation would remind me of the False Peak concept, which I primarily know from exposure to Ai Learning, or in the context of trying to find the highest point in a given map.

1685877589.0,"Why can't humans bioaccumulate heavy metals, such as mercury, in the same way sharks can?","I'm a pescatarian, so I eat a lot of seafood. Of course, most seafood contains mercury thanks to methylmercury absorption by plankton/fish which are subsequently eaten by predatory fish (bioaccumulation). Most of the time, the mercury content won't have an impact on humans. However, humans start suffering from the mercury content once they consume too many ""apex fish predators"" (sharks, baraccuda, tuna, etc).

Those predatory fish, especially sharks, don't suffer from mercury poisoning despite their high mercury consumption. 

I know our biology isn't the same as fish, but why is it that we can't build up a resistance to mercury (or other heavy metals) to the same degree as predatory fish? I've heard it might be possible (the Japanese have been eating seafood heavy diets for tens of thousands of years), but it seems as if we can only ""evolve"" so much in this regard.

1685728362.0,How does a healthy human pancreas prevent low glucose?,"I have type 1 diabetes and manage my blood glucose with a CGM, pump, and insulin (Novorapid which is supposedly identical to human insulin).

Recently I have been using an APS (artificial pancreas system) which links my CGM and pump together to effectively emulate a healthy human pancreas. This APS system doesn't work perfectly and I often have high glucose after meals and occasionally low glucose (usually due to the absorption speed of meals or exercise).

I don't know any of the technical parts of how the pancreas does its job in managing glucose levels, but I have a good understanding of how to manage my own diabetes regardless. 

My main two questions would be:
1. How does the pancreas prevent (or at least reduce) sudden spikes in glucose after a meal?
2. How does insulin on board not affect healthy people (non diabetics) as much during exercise?

To add to the first question, as a T1 diabetic I need to inject (using a pump) a predetermined amount of insulin based on the total carbohydrates in a meal and this is a very rough estimate because absorption speeds can vary greatly. In a closed loop APS, the only way I've seen people prevent spikes (without knowing the carbs) is having insulin already on board but I don't understand how this would be possible in a healthy human body which isn't warned in advance about food.

To add to the second question, it is often too risky for me to exercise just after a meal because of all the insulin on board. The only method I can think of to reduce the risk of a hypo during exercise is to inject less insulin for the meal, but from the first question I either need to know this in advance or I need to be injecting small increments whenever I see a rise in glucose which would also result in hyperglycaemia.

I suppose I should also mention that CGMs measure glucose from the interstitial fluid, so trends are usually delayed by 10-15 minutes (although I'd assume the current glucose level can be extrapolated).
Also there are faster types of insulin available, such as Fiasp and Lyumjev, but I'd like to focus on why human insulin is still effective without needing these properties.

1684926011.0,"AskScience AMA Series: I am Professor Ilan Marek, Director of the Center for Sustainable Processes and Catalysis at Technion, ask me anything!","I am professor Ilan Marek, (https://ilanmarek.technion.ac.il), one of the best synthetic organic chemists in the world today. I have received accolades every single year from different organizations and different countries (the last one being the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, prize which is not frequently awarded to non-American citizens), and have been elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 2017 and to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2019. I am an editorial board member of a long list of important journals in organic chemistry from different countries and societies. I have educated 44 MSc and PhD students and 43 post-doctoral fellows in my career, 26 are now faculty members in different countries and the rest are occupying important positions in various chemical or pharmaceutical companies.

The world population is rapidly expanding. 2.5 new inhabitants (on average) are born every second. By 2050, our planet is going to be inhabited by 10+ billion people. To maintain and improve the global quality of life while meeting the needs of an expanding world population, the production of food, medicine, consumer, and new technology products must be increased to meet this growing demand. Can the world sustain its growing population in the same way we did up to now, without causing additional ecological damage and further depleting natural resources?

To give just one example of the increasing environmental impact of modern life, in the last 70 years, the production of plastic increased from 1.5 million tons per year in 1950 to 450 million tons per year in 2022. That would be fine if one knew how to handle plastics after usage. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Only 9% of plastic is recycled. In 2020 alone, more than 20 million tons of plastics ended up in the sea, creating a floating mass twice the size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean. If we keep on like this, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. If that's not enough, recent studies found micro particles of plastic in people's blood and lungs.

We are in a situation where drastic changes are needed. To support the needs of the growing population, to maintain and improve the life expectancy and life quality we're taking for granted, we cannot just produce more. We need to produce better.

The answer, I believe, lies in catalysis.

A catalyst is any substance that triggers or speeds up a chemical reaction. Catalysts are crucial for life itself: they control our cells, perform our digestion, form part of our immune systems. Catalysts also make modern life possible: they play key roles in food production, drug and materials manufacturing, energy production and many other fields. It is hard to imagine the world today, or indeed civilized society in general, without the impact of catalysis on all fundamental aspects required for life.

Catalysis stands at the nexus of many disciplines, enabling discoveries that impact areas as diverse as health (e.g., medicine, imaging), food (agrichemicals), energy (efficiency, storage, sustainable manufacturing) and more, and as such, forms an important part of the global economy. It is generally associated with underpinning approximately 30% of global GDP, representing roughly 3 trillion USD, and is involved at some point in the processing of 90% of all manufactured products.

To answer these crucial problems, The Technion has created the Resnick Sustainability Center for
Catalysis - the first of its kind in Israel and one of only a handful of similar projects
worldwide - embodies a compelling vision: Innovation in catalysis is key to solving many of the great challenges facing us today. The goal of the Center is to discover and develop new catalysts touching many different fields. This will be achieved by harnessing the Technion's stellar resources in chemistry, biotechnology, physics, biology, computer science, chemical engineering, materials engineering and food engineering - all within a single facility. The Center will serve as an incubator for talent, ideas and solutions, not only strengthening the Technion's reputation as a world leader in this area but also potentially ensuring that the Israeli economy benefits from the improved industrial processes and a lucrative set of exportable technologies that will result from their implementation.

In contrast to the traditional laboratory setup - in which researchers work in isolation from each other - The Resnick Sustainability Center for Catalysis will feature an innovative open space research laboratory model, providing lab space for new faculty members and their teams. There are several reasons for this approach: to enhance multidisciplinary collaboration in a field that is evolving ever more rapidly, to pool the use of advanced pieces of equipment among multiple researchers, and to encourage researchers from two or more academic disciplines to combine their expertise to solve major problems in the field. The Technion believes that the pace of innovation and discovery made possible by this open-space laboratory setup is likely to exceed the pace expected from a conventional lab arrangement.

Now, we know that astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are moving much faster than we are on Earth and experience a weaker gravitational pull. Over the course of their stay on the ISS, their clocks would tick slower relative to ours, but this effect is extremely tiny given the speeds and gravitational differences involved.  
  
My question is: what tangible effects, if any, does this difference in the passage of time have on the astronauts' bodies and minds? Does it affect their biological clocks, circadian rhythms, or even the rate at which they age?  
  
Also, on a psychological level, do astronauts report feeling any different in their perception of time? I've read reports of many astronauts experiencing what is known as the ""overview effect"", a cognitive shift in their understanding of life and reality when viewing the Earth from space. Could changes in the passage of time contribute to this phenomenon in any way?

So say you have two tiger cubs. Both the same size. You feed them each the same quantity of meat every day (progressively they both get more as they grow etc.) You feed them cows. But one gets 6 KG worth of Runt cow meat, and one gets 6 KG worth of cow meat from ONLY the biggest cows in the herd (but both the runt and big cow are the same age!) Is there an actual different between the quality of meat? And will one tiger grow up to be stronger/healthier because of the meat’s quality?

Again, maybe something in this example doesn’t make sense, sorry about that. 
An example with humans is that someone eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are small, and someone else eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are gigantic. But both bananas came from the same place and were the same age.

1684493150.0,Can empirical evidence exist for specific selective pressures in evolution?,"To start, I'm a biologist and am absolutely NOT questioning evolutionary theory. What's been bothering me though is when people ask the question ""Why did Trait X evolve""? What they're asking of course is ""Why was Trait X advantageous?"". Usually someone comes up with some logical reason why Trait X was advantageous allowing everyone to sit around and ponder whether or not the explanation is reasonable. If something doesn't come to mind that makes more sense, the explanation is usually agreed upon and everyone moves on. Ok cool, but we know of course that not all traits are propagated by natural selection. Some are propagated by genetic drift. Some traits may not confer a particular reproductive/survival advantage, they could be neutral, or just not mal-adaptive enough to be selected out of the population. 

So, outside of inductive logic, can we ever have empirical evidence for what factor(s) caused Trait X to be selected? I can sit here and tell you that a particular bird evolved feather patterns to blend in with its surroundings, thus giving it the adaptive advantage of avoiding predators, but this may not be true at all - it could be sexual selection or genetic drift that caused the trait to persist. While some adaptations selective pressures may be so obvious that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent, many are not so obvious and we should be cautious assigning causation when only correlation may exist.",0.91,162

1684425151.0,Why do freshwater lakes & rivers seem to have less biological structure than oceans?,"I've recently learned to scuba dive, and naturally I've been looking up all the places I might be able to dive in the future, and asking experienced divers I know their thoughts about where the most interesting spots to dive with aquatic life are.

I've been surprised to find that freshwater lakes and rivers don't seem to have much in the way of macroscopic biological structures that create habitat, unlike oceans (which have corals, kelp forests, soft-bodied anemones, huge clam beds, seagrass meadows, etc). It also seems that freshwater animals stem from a severely restricted subset of overall aquatic life. Divers have been telling me that the only really interesting stuff to see in freshwater are wrecks. This is wild to me.

I spent a while trying to find out whether there were structurally complex biological underwater environments in the Great Lakes, thinking that massive lakes must surely support lots of interesting variety, but I'm not finding much variety in environments beyond scenes of greyish fish swimming around over relatively flat sediment or rocky bottoms.

I'm confused by this. I know that small ponds and bogs can be full of stuff like rushes and lily pads and duckweed and other things, so I'd expect to see that sort of environment grow larger and more varied with more space in lakes and rivers. With shallower waters (compared to the ocean) and a high ratio of edge-to-area where biomass from land can enter the water to provide nutrients or evolutionary access points, I'd have thought there would be an abundant variety of aquatic plant life, and that you'd see things like kelp forests or lily pad groves or lake-grass meadows; and I know freshwater hydras exist, so I'm surprised there aren't freshwater sessile cnidarians forming beds along lake bottoms. 

I've heard the mineral content of freshwater is too low for animals that form hard structures like corals, but there are plenty of soft-bodied structures in the ocean too that don't seem to have developed in freshwater. There are a few microbialites in places like Pavilion Lake, BC, but those seem to exist in lakes that are otherwise relatively low in biological activity.

What are some of the factors that prevent these things from evolving in freshwater? Or do they exist plentifully elsewhere, maybe just not at temperate latitudes?",0.85,29

I'm no geologist, but I've been in plenty of limestone caves to know these basic facts (which I'm spelling out so that I may be corrected if I'm operating on incorrect knowledge): Limestone is soluble in acid, and water is ever so slightly acidic (there's also a role played by microbes). A flow of water causes the slow dissolution  of the limestone over time, eventually carving a cave system.

Now salt is far more easily soluble than limestone in water, so there should have been vast natural caverns. And there is certainly water present under there, I saw it, and it needs to be pumped as in most mines.

So where are the caves?",0.91,47

1683846832.0,Why a rocket nozzle needs both a converging and diverging section?,"I've been watching the BPS Space youtube videos on making a solid rocket motor, and the intuitive reasons for having a converging and diverging section don't really make sense. It seems like if there's a conservation of energy, then sending all the mass out the back of the engine would yield the same thrust, as long as the exhaust can all be directed backwards.

So the diverging section makes sense, it allows the exhaust to expand and bounce off the walls of the nozzle, ending it directly backwards. And in an ideal situation the pressure at the exit of the nozzle is exactly ambient and all the exhaust is going directly backwards.

But wouldn't that happen anyways without the converging part?

I keep seeing people say that the converging part gets the velocity up to mach 1, and that chokes the nozzle. Does that mean that because the nozzle is choked the pressure inside the combustion chamber can get higher since the exhaust can't get out of the nozzle any faster, no matter how high the pressure is? And then because there's a higher pressure, more energy can be extracted from the pressure differential? If that's the case I don't understand how the higher pressure affects the downstream exhaust? How does it make the exhaust move faster in the diverging part?",0.88,20

1683688088.0,how does immunity work?,"I understand that your body can adapt to harmful substances such as poison and become immune, for example, I know a story about a king of ancient times who took small sips of poison every so often to develop immunity, and one day he tried to take his life because they were going to overthrow him and he could not because the poison had no effect on him (lmao).

so my question is why is it possible to become immune to some things like the poison of a rattlesnake, and not to others like for example mercury.

Is it because venom is a biological composition of proteins and complex molecules and the body can learn to ""dismantle"" it and mercury is a simple metal?

I've been studying neuro-pathology and have been having difficulty in understanding how the pathophysiology of PD results in its clinical manifestation. This probably has an obvious answer but I haven't been able to figure it out.

What I've understood till now is that there's destruction of the dopamine-producing neurons in the Pars Compacta layer of the Substantia Nigra. Dopamine generally counters the normal inhibitory influence on motor activity in the Basal Ganglia so a decrease in dopamine would naturally make it harder to initiate muscle movement.

This would explain the bradykinesia, gait disturbances and dysarthria **but how would this result in rigidity and the resting pin-rolling tremor.** Why would this be seen when motor activity is already reduced?

Here are two descriptions that are not behind paywall:

[https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage\_hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity)

I'm not in this field so take my description with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that for this type of power generation, water is used to generate electricity by gravity, similar to standard hydroelectric power (e.g. a dam), but in 'off hours', excess electricity is used to pump water up from a lower reservoir to an upper one. When more electricity is needed, that upper reservoir is used (gravity flow down to lower reservoir) to generate electricity. 

I must be missing something--to my mind, based on classical physics, this seems like it must be inefficient--how can we pump water uphill with electricity, then use that water flowing back downhill to generate more electricity than it took to pump it uphill? I must be missing something--perhaps there's always a secondary source of power churning in the background that is always available for electricity generation, so it's just excess electricity from this that is used to pump water uphill?

1683011973.0,"Question: Can cellulose fibers (Claire, 2023), be impregnated and coated with a metallic-matrix-infused polymer coating to increase conductivity and reduce flammability? (Additional details and Sources in the Post)","  

Hello,

I came across this article today (it was a busy weekend) and wanted some opinions on some thoughts inspired by it. The article is from Tyson (2023), which details an experiment that showed wood (altered) can be used to conduct electricity (Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023). Tran et al. 2023, imply (to me) that the outcome was essentially a cellulose product that can be impregnated with a polymer to help conduct electricity and likely reduce the flammability. However, if I understand (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019) correctly; given the assumption that if heat can be used to create energy (Chu,2018), the opposite is true; and if that is the case heat is likely to be a byproduct from electricity (assumption based on energy loss/entropy). 

So, my initial question is: 

If Tyson (2023) and Tran et al. (2023) allow for a cellulose material  (impregnated in a polymer) that improves conductivity (and likely reduces flammability), and some concerns are conductivity of cellulose and the flammability (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). An additional factor is an ability to create flame-retardant cellulose fibers better (Claire, 2023; Salmeia et al., 2016) and potentially combine them with the properties allocated (in this posting) to Tran et al., 2023. Primarily the impregnation and coating of the material with a polymer to increase conductivity and assumedly to reduce flammability (Chu, 2018; Salmeia et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023; Zhang et al., 2019). Could a layer of conductive metals, silver (Tran et al., 2023) or a silver and superalloy mixture (Sands, 2022; T. Smith, 2022; T. M. Smith et al., 2023); with an outer coating of the polymer that also incorporates a matrix structure (within the polymer) to facilitate conductivity better (Pan et al., 2022) comprised of the metals used, increase conductivity, and additively decrease flammability?

Additional Questions: Could the cellulose fibers (flame retardant) be created to include a matrix of metal fibers (second option) within its structure and be subsequently impregnated and further coated, as inquired about above?

   Thanks for any help or responses; I was trying to de-stress and grow (or correct my knowledge base). Have a Good Day!!

With less melanin acting as sunglasses in the iris, it allows for better photon reception, thus letting more light in.

Anyways, if someone has blue eyes, and they moved up to Scandinavia in a darker region, would the melanin in their iris eventually lower and bring out a brighter shade of blue?

1682751896.0,Why don’t the spectral lines of a substance correspond to its observable color?,"If my question is confusing, it’s like this:

Every substance has spectral emission and absorption lines. We can use those to identify substances in and around objects in space, for example. However, these absorption and emission lines don’t correspond to the color of a substance if I were to look at it in a macroscopic amount. 

Like the spectral lines for indium make it appear indigo (hence the name) but in reality it is a silvery-white metal. Iodine (afaik) also has pretty weak violet lines in its spectra, but it appears that color in vapor form. This is odd to me because what a substance absorbs and reflects directly contributes to its color, and spectral lines (which describe that concept) seemingly don’t match up.

Operating in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, we track the health of the reefs in the area and evaluate each country's reef management efforts. I have a PhD in Marine Science from the University of South Florida and have also worked for the World Wildlife Fund and the Smithsonian Institution. I'm the author of more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers and the recipient of the 2021 Conservation Award from the International Coral Reef Society.

In 2013, an uncharted coral reef was discovered off the coast of Belize and Guatemala - but was kept rather secret until this year. Dubbed ""The Cayman Crown,"" this reef surpasses the size of Manhattan and is a refuge for a vast array of marine life, from schools of yellow jack and blue tang to bottlenose dolphins to the critically endangered - and commercially important - Nassau grouper. While not wholly immune to the dangers that face other reefs, such as overfishing, bleaching and invasive species, this reef's remarkable resilience is likely due to its position on the edge of the Cayman Trench. The hope is that this discovery can mark a new chapter in understanding corals and in saving coral reefs worldwide.

The Cayman Crown was given protected status in 2020 by both Belize and Guatemala, but there is still much to be done to ensure its conservation. You can learn more and see the first-ever footage of the reef in the new PBS *Nature* documentary ""[Treasure of the Caribbean](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/about-treasure-caribbean/28747/),"" now available to stream in the US.

1682551995.0,Antiviral medications - What are their different traits and applications in real life scenarios?,"Hello,

I was curious about Antiviral medications.  For instance, there is an antiviral available for HIV now,  ART.  There are also Antivirals for things like Herpes Simplex 1; Acyclovir and others.

Antibiotics, to my understanding, are essentially a nuke.  They kill everything in the infected region.  We don't have that technique available to us for Viruses, though.  

So, I was curious - what are the traits of these Antivirals and what mechanisms do they have that result in successful treatment?  

Are Antivirals creating an environment that is prohibitive towards the Host's virus in their system, causing them to not duplicate or fail to do so?

And one more on the same topic - Are they basically the same medication, but just used in different quantities?  For instance, would ART also treat Herpes Simplex 1, Simplex 2, etc?  

Or are they entirely different in their form and function to treat other viruses?

Thank you for your time",0.89,34

She looked at the picture in which it looked pretty big and called the Weight stat. To her disbelief the card was beaten by my Beluga whale. They looked pretty similar, however her shark's weight of 87kg was dwarfed by the Beluga's 1,400kg.

However, my daughter then grabbed the Basking Shark card, which while twice as long as the Sand tiger shark had a weight of 5,200kg, or almost 60 times the weight.

If you are in the USA, there is a 70-80% chance you have pyrethroid pesticide metabolites in your blood right now. If you have a can of bug spray, they are likely in it. If someone sprays for insects in your apartment or home, this is likely what they are spraying. If you are in an area where they fog for mosquitoes, this is what they are spraying. It is used in landscaping in public green spaces and businesses. These pesticides are everywhere - and for good reason. They are considered completely safe for adults.

And yet, multiple recent studies have shown that exposure to pyrethroid class pesticides during pregnancy, or even just having them used within a mile of your house, is a risk factor for autism and neurodevelopmental disorders in the unborn child.

In my research, published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, we exposed three separate cohorts of pregnant mice to a ""safe"" low dose of the pyrethroid deltamethrin during pregnancy and lactation, then we examined the offspring. All three cohorts of offspring had hyperactivity, reduced vocalizations, increased repetitive behaviors, failed basic learning tests, and had wide ranging disruptions in the dopamine system in the brain. All symptoms which, in humans, are related to autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Bruce Ames (father of the Ames test for mutagenicity) advocated for the idea of ""Carcinogenic Potency"" in weighting health risks of different chemicals.

But why are there two chambers per side? An atrium and a ventricle. The explanation we got in school is that the atrium pumps blood into the ventricle which then pumps it out of the heart. So the left ventricle can pump blood throughout the entire body and the left atrium only needs to pump blood *down* a couple of centimeters? That seems a bit uneven in terms of capabilities.

First year bio student, just curious about how there seem to be so many zoonotic diseases originating in birds that can spread to humans. There's also a lot originating from other mammals like bats and rats, but that makes sense since humans are relatively closely related to them, and have really similar body systems and tissues. But birds confuse me as a common source of zoonotic diseases. I understand that they're really effective vectors and spreaders of disease, since they can cover so much distance easily and poop often all over the place, but on a biological system level I don't really understand. Birds and humans haven't shared an ancestor since over 200 million years ago, and have significantly different digestive and respiratory systems.   


Rambling aside, what i'm asking is why are we so compatible with birds in terms of diseases? How do so many diseases infect both birds and humans equally as easily when we're so different?

Now I know little about engineering, but I see us blow up mountains, dig under the ocean, erect suspension bridges miles long, etc., so it's hard for me to understand how construction anywhere on the surface of the Earth is ""impossible"".

1681595728.0,How does Parental Age affects the Probability of Having Healthy Offspring?,"I analyzed recent scientific articles on the effect of parental age on the probability of producing a healthy kid: https://empirical-wonderland.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-effect-of-parental-age-on.html

However, I am not a biologist or a doctor myself. If anybody is also interested in this topic or has more knowledge on the subject, please have a look at my summary and let me know if you find any errors or disagree with me. Any comments are appreciated.

In a nutshell, I found that the probability of a woman getting pregnant in one year of trying (sex every 3 days) drops from 86% (at 20 years old) to 53% (at 40 years old). The probability of miscarriage also increases from 10% to 25%, while the probability of a birth defect rises from 1% to 15%, with an acceleration in this trend after the age of 40.

For men, the effects of age were less pronounced. The probability of making a woman pregnant within a year decreases by approximately 10% after the age of 40, compared to the age of 30. However, older men also tend to have less sex than younger ones. After 40, men increase the probability of miscarriage by 1.23 times (how I understood, it increases from 10% to 12% for a partner in her 20s, but this could be wrong) compared to 25-29. Finally, advanced paternal age has a significant positive effect on the rate of birth defects. However, the rate is generally low. For example, orofacial clefts have a probability lower than 0.2%. For fathers over 45, this probability is up to 0.3%.",0.79,35

If take B as a reference point, A should have a potential of 5V.

let's say I have a 2 ohm resistor connected between the positive terminal and A.

The circuit is open, there is no voltage drop across this resistor, hence A still has a potential of 5V.

if I connect a current source across that resistor, say 5A, then ohm's law tells us that the resistor has a voltage drop of 10V.

What i want to know is that does A now have a potential of 5V-10V = -5V? does the voltage drop across the resistor caused by the current cause the potential of the battery's positive terminal to drop across the resistor?

both could be traveling the same speed relative to the ground although the parts per second would be higher for the higher ppm parcel.

Sure, that makes sense.

However, my question arises when I physically see lines of flux when I scatter iron filings around a magnet. Surely these are not just a representation but a physical reality. In other words, if they were \*just\* a representation, we wouldn't observe them in the exact same way in physical reality, just as you would never be able to ""see"" the sine wave representing pressure changes moving through the air when describing sound, because that is not what is physically happening.

I'm curious why everything I can find says that they are merely a representation, and yet we can physically see lines forming from iron filings. What's going on there?

1680921386.0,Why does wetting a scored mark on glass make it easier to break the glass cleanly?,">Wheeler,(1958). Scientific Glassblowing, Interscience Publishers, New York & London. Chapter IV Basic Operations, Page 56. ""Milligan has found that the strength of glass containing cracks is greatly influenced by a liquid in contact with the surface of the glass. Exposure of the surface to air saturated with alcohol or water greatly reduces the strength. Putting a drop of water on the crack reduces the strength by about 20% whereas moistening the crack with dry paraffin oil strengthens the tube by about 20%. Milligan does not advance an explanation for either of these effects, but many glassblowers can attest to the accuracy of the statement that water in the scratch reduces the strength of the glass tubing"".

To cut glass, a cutting tool is used to make a scored line, then the glass is tapped or torqued and the stress concentration at the scratch causes the glass to break along the desired line.

Glassblowers always suggest wetting the scored mark to make the break easier, cleaner, and more reliable. Why does this work?

1680633335.0,Why does the parasite have to go through the mosquito for humans to get Filariasis?,"Filariasis or Elephantiasis is a human disease caused by the nematode parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The adult parasite gives birth to a microfilaria from the lymphatic system. The worm then goes into the human's circulatory system, gets sucked by a mosquito, develops until it is reintroduced to another human host and develop into adults in the lymphatic system. Thus its cycle. I have heard that the mosquito is a necessary step in the cycle, but I don't see why other than it being the transmission vector. Is there another reason the parasite has to go through the mosquito in order for it to develop? Do mosquitoes contribute to the nematode's development?

So with all that empty space, what’s stopping the molecules from getting closer together?

Additionally, as something gets colder, it’s volume shrinks. Hot air will rise above cold air. We were also told that was because the molecules are moving faster.

The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and [genomic instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_instability). 

I recently was doing some reading on non-mutagenic carcinogens, and came upon an article, [*Mechanisms of non-genotoxic carcinogens and importance of a weight of evidence approach*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383574209000428), which states very clearly, emphasis mine:

Non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide  variety of mechanisms of cancer induction including receptor-mediated  endocrine modulation, non-receptor mediated endocrine modulation, tumor  promoting, inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory  responses, immunosuppressants, or gap junction intercellular  communication

1680157014.0,Is osmotic pressure involved in the circulation of ions through a cell membrane ?,"Hi,

I have a neurobiology course, and I have a doubt about something my teacher wrote in the syllabus of the course.

It  says that ions can circulate through the membrane of a neuron via  receptors, and that there is two major factors influencing the  circulation of ions : 1) an electrical force, due to the eletric  potential difference between the outside and the inside of the cell. 2) a  ""chemical force"" (sic) due to the difference in ions concentration,  ""also called osmotic force"".

I have 3 questions :

1. is the concept of ""chemical force"" a valid one ?
2. most  importantly, I'm note very qualified in chemistry, but it seems to me  that osmotic pressure is by definition related to the circulation of a  solvent through a semi-permeable membrane... here the ions are the  solute if I'm not wrong... so how can osmotic pressure have something to  do with this ?

As  an analogy, I am sitting in the stands at a football stadium and I am  staring at the 50 yard line, but I see the uprights and goalpost because  there is a black hole on the 49 yard line (oops) that is  deflecting/warping the light by 90 degrees and toward my eyes.",0.85,15
1680086419.0,I see that scientists are achieving better algorithm performance with AI-generated training data. I have a hard time wrapping around my head what that means. What does it mean?,"Hi,  


So a little background. I have been working as a product manager in the ML space for a while. I enjoy the new technology and I think the new advancements done in LLM is really impressive. I know a little bit about the space, but the space is huge and I, of course, have been trying to understand things that is related to my work.  


However, I feel like we are jumping to some extreme conclusions when are talking about this subject. I hear in podcasts and on linkedin that with the recent improvements we can get better performance with algorithmic generated training data, and I've seen a few papers linked. I guess it looks legit, but I have not seen anyone smart explain what that means, to a non technical person like myself. People are very eager to take that truth and jump to the next conclusion built on top of this; ""with self improving algorithms we will be able to bla bla bla bla"". 

So, if I understand things correctly, we need to tell the model what is good knowledge (training data), and we need to give one (or more) goal function(s) to optimize for (?). In the Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) interview by Lex Fridman, Sam clearly states that they put a lot of effort into the pre-training data set (and is very non-talkative about the composition of the data, which I guess is probably one of the main company secrets). This is the knowledge that is put in to the model, this is where we tell it what is true (and potentially what is not true). We give it a, or a few, metrics to optimize for, and it finds the correct tuning on the parameters over the epochs of training. In ChatGPT's case it is also adding a human into the loop, to fine tune the model by giving two options and letting the human select the best version, also stated in the interview. 

If we conclude that we can generate better algorithmic output with algorithmically generated training data, what does that mean? To me it sounds like we can squeeze a little more performance of the model, not that we can feed the models infinitely, with better and better training data that it has produced. What is that data, even? What happened to the truths we fed the model?",0.69,9
1680094701.0,"Can our body make an association between food and the circumstances in which we first had it, and can it process food differently based on this association?","I've been doing some work on personal trauma recently, and I'm curious about how the body responds to these sort of things. Food can often bring up a lot of memories (smell being a powerful sense, of course).

Specifically, I remember having porridge a lot for breakfast as a child - pretty robust breakfast I suppose, with carbs, fibre and some protein. I've not had it in a long time, but had it again more recently and felt I'd been hanging on to more weight than usual, when I look at the scales.

Given childhood, in my case, was often filled with a myriad of stress-inducing situations, including fast-paced mornings where breakfast was often eaten quickly, I wondered if there's any link between specific foods (more than just nutritional connections, like carbs, etc.) and the circumstances in which we first had it that might contribute to how we process foods, excluding potential factors like speed of eating (I understand that can affect these things also)?

Could the stressful situation of childhood breakfast times that perhaps triggers some evolutionary mechanism in my body that thinks it would be better to process certain foods in different ways?

I.e., body thinks something is in trouble in stressful situation, decides that circumstances might be difficult, decides to put food into fat storage for resources, situation repeats and food becomes associated with particular mode of processing.

This could be absolute nonsense, but I wondered if there might be any robust scientific literature on this based on my own limited understanding of ourselves, even if it disproves this. Given how complex our body is though, and the connections it can make between particular things related to trauma, it's a question that sounds interesting to explore.

I suppose it might be referred to as a psychosomatic connection - I've heard that term thrown around, but happy to be corrected on that.",0.79,4

1680038059.0,"Why are Euarchontoglires much more likely to be omnivores, to be small, and to be social than other mammals?","What I mean is I have a hypothesis.

Euarchontoglires were apparently originally obligate omnivores: that explain why some of them are great scavengers, and why they can tolerate MUCH MORE ethanol, caffeine and theobromine than almost all other animals. To be exact, all apes (such as gibbons and humans), rabbits, squirrels, murids (such as brownn rats and house mice), cricetids (such as hamsters), and caviids (such as Guinea pigs and capybaras) can all drink coffee, and eat chocolate, for many other animals, they are very toxic (just ask birds, squamates, felines, canids, and even equids). Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with carnivorous tendancies include mandrills, baboons, aye-ayes, and water rats. Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with herbivorous tendencies include gorillas, lemurs, and squirrels. Euarchontoglires that really are obligate omnivores include anatomically modern humans, chimpanzees (both common chimpanzees and bonobos formerly known as pygmy chimpanzees), pen-tailed treeshrews, hamsters, brown rats, and house mice. The only Euarchontoglires that are obligate carnivores I know are tarsiers, and the only Euarchontoglires I know that are obligate herbivores I know are caviids, beavers, and mole-rats.

Also, most Euarchontoglires are small: the world's largest extant Euarchontoglires species is either the anatomically modern human (*Homo sapiens*) (if we are talking about both height, and legspan), or the eastern gorilla (*Gorilla beringei*) (if we are talking about mass, volume, and armspan), or the tetraploid rodent (I forgot its scientific name, sorry) (if we are talking about genome size). If we include extinct species, there was a South American rodent that weighed 1,000 kilograms, or even more, and maybe *Gigantopithecus blacki* was 2.4-3.6 metres tall with a mass of 350-1,000 kilograms.

Finally, Euarchontoglires tend to be gregarious (such as rabbits, beavers, and gibbons), or alternatively prosocial (such as capybaras, brown rats, house mice, lemurs, gorillas, and chimpanzees), or even eusocial (such as mole-rats, and, in a sense, humans). Among the exceptions, there are orangutans (which are solitary in an on and off manner), and hamsters (which are obligate solitary). However, some Euarchontoglires are pacifists (such as bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, capybaras, and Guinea pigs), other are warriors (such as brown rats, house mice, baboons, mandrills, common chimpanzees, and humans) (I sometimes say that, in comparison to humans, orangutans are autistic empaths, and hamsters are schizophrenic sociopaths).

1679955367.0,Are there any extant nonmarine carnivorous flightless birds?,"I ask because I know that most extant birds (either flying or flightless) are omnivores.

I also know that the only two extant birds species that are obligate herbivores are the unique hoatzin and the strange kakapo, one is a poor flyer, the other is really flightless, but a great climber.

Formerly, there were nonmarine carnivorous flightless birds such as phorusrhacids (or terror birds, if you want), and the mysterious Jamaican caracara (these two examples are both australavians like the kakapo, but the former is related to seriamas, and the latter was technically the world's only flightless species from the order Falconiformes). Since they are all dead, the only living carnivorous birds are the famous penguins, and the critically endangered flightless cormorant. Both penguins and cormorants are marine obligate carnivores.

However, I think there still could be an extant nonmarine carnivorous flightless bird: the kagu (this species is exclusively found in New-Caledonia, which is part of the Fifth French Republic).",0.78,9

Follow-up if nutrtion profile does not change: If I have the nutritional data for a food by weight, and I cook the food, it will have less weight. Will the resulting food have the same nutrition as the uncooked food I start with (is the weight loss only water?)

I started thinking about this while being pitched a raw food diet for my dog. The premise doesn't make sense to me for the same reason that dog owners who feed their dogs raw meet likely aren't eating raw meat themselves, but the claim is that it has a health benefit for the dog and I have no knowledge of that but am thinking that if it does, surely it would apply to humans as well.

If you want the most bang for your buck (both volume and mass wise) why not step up the voltage a capacitor charges at super duper high? Then the energy of the capacitor is proportional to the volume * permittivity * dielectric strength ^2. Why not have a centimeter of diamond between two plates with a potential difference of a million or so volts? That’s good energy density right there.

Then why don't we see anything 15k, 30k, 50k, or even 100k years back?","Edit: since that stupid show ""Ancient Apocalypse"" is getting a bunch of attention at the moment, let me be clear the following has NOTHING to do with that. I do not believe there's some advanced lost civilisation, I do not believe in atlantians, I do not believe these sea people came and gave this technology to these people. I just don't understand how ~12k years ago we go from extremely simple building engineering, to Karaahan Tepe. The advancement to Göbekli Tepe a few k years later though makes total sense, you can see the gradual improvements they made from KT to GT, it's linear progress.  But KT appears to suddenly jump into existence, during the younger dryas at that. It just feels to me either I'm missing something deep, or perhaps there could be a chain of similar sites going back 15k, 20k, 30k, etc years (but even then I ask why did it take between ~250k years or ~40k years to figure out the early ones?).

Karahan Tepe, the older sister site of the world famous Göbekli Tepe, appears to be around 12,000 years old.

All of the evidence we have found so far suggests they were hunter gatherers who may have been doing small amounts of agriculture (which is backed up by genetic tracing of our modification of species, which happened over thousands of years). And on top of that did not have pottery.

Of course I've heard that this may imply that it may not have been agriculture that allowed us the time and requirements to build structures like this, but structures like this that allowed us to start agriculture. Or (what I would lean to) is that it was a slow mix of each pushing each other along.

But what I don't understand, is if humans were capable of this back then with essentially pre/minimal-agriculture, then why don't we see any further back?

Why weren't we building these structures 15,000 years ago. Or 30,000? Or 50,000? Or even 100,000?

I understand about the ice age (although some of the PPN sites seemed like they may have developed in the younger dryas, which makes even less sense?). But there were still warmer climates with humans in them.

Why did it take us ~250k years to suddenly figure this out, and then when we do figure it out, we're suddenly pretty damn good at it? Or even if you follow that humans only became behaviourally modem 70k years ago, again why did it take 60k years?

It just doesn't make much sense to me. Humans who could figure out how to make stone weapons, fire, primitive homes, etc, surely absolutely understood that you could chip away and grind away stone.

Is it possible we just haven't found these yet? And that there's just fewer due to lower population? It feels obvious to me that there must be some missing as there's such a jump to the PPN ones.

1679456139.0,Would the metastability of Tantalum-180m1 change anything about its physical properties if it were isolated?,"Tantalum-180m1 is the only primordial nuclear isomer, and is observationally stable, unlike its ground state which has a half life of about 8 hours.

According to Wikipedia, it has sufficient energy to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, and electron capture to 180Hf. However, no radioactivity from any decay mode of this nuclear isomer has ever been observed. Only a lower limit on its half-life of over 1015 years has been set, by observation. The very slow decay of 180mTa is attributed to its high spin (9 units) and the low spin of lower-lying states. Gamma or beta decay would require many units of angular momentum to be removed in a single step, so that the process would be very slow.

Compared to common Tantalum-181 which composes 99.98799% of natural Tantalum, 180mTa has a natural occurrence of 0.01201%.

It is thought to be created via photodisintegration of common Tantalum-181 causing neutron emission, so hypothetically more could be made by bombarding 181Ta with gamma rays. 

The closest thing to having a significant amount of 180mTa in one place right now would probably be in the Majorana Demonstrator, where 17.4 kilograms of pure Tantalum, including about 2.088 grams of 180mTa, are being observed in an effort to try to find the elusive decay of the isotope.

If 180mTa were extracted by isotope separation from 181Ta, would its metastability change anything about its properties? Unlike other nuclear isomers, appreciable amounts of it would be able to be created, separated, and gathered in one place without having to worry about it decaying into something else.

1678978378.0,What does imitation relating to mirror neurons ACTUALLY mean?," 

So I am very familiar with the concept of mirror neurons and all of the debate surrounding them. I need some help understanding what they actually mean? I have done some research and asked professors and can't get a clear answer.

I know the idea is that mirror neurons are supposedly neurons that fire when you observe AND do an action (neurons that are activated when you reach for something are also activated when you see someone else reach). 

I really do not think that mirror neurons “cause” imitation, but I am confused on something. If someone is watching a video of an actor reaching for targets and has to tap a key corresponding to where the actor reaches, what would the expected results be? My question is, if an actor reaches to a target on THEIR right (OBSERVER’S left) and the observer has a shorter reaction time to respond to the same target (by hitting a left key) than opposite (hitting the right key), could mirror neurons be a possible explanation? Or not, because mirror neurons would imply that observer’s would be faster to hit the THEIR right (exactly imitating the action of the person on screen?). 

I guess my question is just if the “imitation” in mirror neurons refer to things from the observer’s point of view, or the actor’s. In simpler terms, would mirror neuron theories mean that an observer would be more inclined to match the direction of someone (mirroring them…Actor-Left-Arm Movement would lead to Observer-Right-Arm-Movement) or the action of someone (Actor-Left-Arm-Movement would lead to Observer-Left-Arm-Movement).

1678985930.0,Is there much difference between dexamphetamine and dextroamphetamine?,"Hope its ok to post this here - was looking for input from those who understand the science of drugs, as I am trying to establish if one of my ADHD medications (prescribed) is prohibited from being brought into Japan (quite hard to get up to date accurate info).

\*\*Just to be clear, I am NOT going to use any info I am given here to determine if I can bring it with me, I am continuing to research this, trying to get in contact with relevant authorities etc, and unless I have confirmation from said authorities I will not bring it. This post is just to help set my expectations in the meantime!\*\*

The medication in question is **dexamphetamine** (brand name Amfexa) which I take in the afternoons.

I know that Adderall is not allowed under any circumstances - and this contains **amphetamine** and **dextroamphetamine.**

**Lisdexamphetamine** on the other hand, *is* allowed, as long as you get a special permit (This is what I take in the mornings).

You can see the full list of controlled substances and their categories [here](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/dl_data/keitai/list.pdf) \- Amphetamine is listed as a ""stimulant"" and strictly prohibited, lisdexamphetamine is listed as ""stimulant raw materials"" and as I say allowed with a permit. They don't actually specify dextroamphetamine or dexamphetamine anywhere.

When I search dexamphetamine, many of the search results come back with dextroamphetamine and it often doesn't seem to differentiate between them, some people also call Amfexa the ""UK Adderall"" as they are very similar (although Adderall is not licensesd here in the UK either)

So I was just wondering, is there a fundamental difference in them, in the same way that there is with lisdexamphetamine (which as I say is permitted). I know lisdexa is slow release, and dexa is instant, and the ban is presumably to do with preventing abuse. But I thought this was the reason Adderall isn't licensed in the UK, whereas dexa is commonly prescribed by psychiatrists.

1686218851.0,"How exactly does ""stability"" work in analytical anion groups from qualitative analysis?","(Just a heads up, I'm painfully aware of how obnoxiously long this is, Sorry about that!)

What exactly does stability of the group reagent (dil HCl, conc H2SO4, BaCl2, etc..) mean in this context?

To quote my textbook exactly (this is highschool-level chem by the way, but feel free to add more details as long as the explanation itself has that in mind): ""Hydrochloric acid is **more stable** than the acids from which the group anions are derived, so when it reacts with these anions salts, it replaces the less stable acids which are easy to volatilize or decompose in the form of gases which can be detected by suitable reagents ""

Is it an inherent property of any reagent in isolation, which is then compared to the required anions' acids (at least for groups whose reagent is an acid) to determine the suitable reagent for each group (As in Kc of the reagent and the produced acid are orders of magnitudes apart that the reagent's anions are undetectable?, but that wouldn't really make sense considering HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids dissociation-wise), So if all we cared about was that the reagents don't dissociate much relative to the products (ppt./volatile gas), considering strong acids would be borderline stupid.

Is it a property that is fundementally dependent on the ions in question, as in that it's defined as being ""with respect to"" said anion rather than ""more stable _than_"" it in some universal sense?
(At least for when the group reagent is a specific salt (BaCl2, for example), is it that the salt's cation really ""wants"" to bond with its group anions, beacuse that chemical releases a significant amount energy when formed which is what stability normally means, but then again, what about strong acids?)

Is it more nuanced than this? Is it a blend of these views? 

Also is it different depending on whether the reagent is an acid, a salt, an acidified other type of chemical, or something else? I mean, they are different chemicals and it would make sense that they get different treatments when deciding what reagent works for what, but then again, I have no idea what stability means *in this context* so I'm probably being unnecessarily verbose because I'm missing something pretty simple.

1685877589.0,"Why can't humans bioaccumulate heavy metals, such as mercury, in the same way sharks can?","I'm a pescatarian, so I eat a lot of seafood. Of course, most seafood contains mercury thanks to methylmercury absorption by plankton/fish which are subsequently eaten by predatory fish (bioaccumulation). Most of the time, the mercury content won't have an impact on humans. However, humans start suffering from the mercury content once they consume too many ""apex fish predators"" (sharks, baraccuda, tuna, etc).

Those predatory fish, especially sharks, don't suffer from mercury poisoning despite their high mercury consumption. 

I know our biology isn't the same as fish, but why is it that we can't build up a resistance to mercury (or other heavy metals) to the same degree as predatory fish? I've heard it might be possible (the Japanese have been eating seafood heavy diets for tens of thousands of years), but it seems as if we can only ""evolve"" so much in this regard.

I was thinking about this while looking at a lightning strike that curved quite weirdly, and struck something that really didn't seem like the most optimal point. I had never really thought to look deeper into how it, and the whole ""path of least resistance"" thing worked and accepted that statement at face value. While thinking about how it would work, I tried to picture the below experiment in my head, but couldn't quite make sense of it. I don't have the means to actually do it myself, but I'm still burningly curious and google has not helped.  


Two long rods of different conductive materials are connected in the middle of their length by a strip of a third conductive material. One of the two rods is made of a material with ""medium"" conductivity, while the other is substantially more conductive. The strip in the middle is still conductive but is much poorer at it than either of the other two. Attached to the ""medium"" conductivity rod is a source of electricity. For instance a Car Battery.   


How would electricity flow in this situation? Would it follow the ""medium"" rod to it's end, ignoring the bridge over? Personally I am not sure if it would be able to realize that there is a potentially ""better"" path for it on the other side of this obstacle, obviously since there is no intelligence to it. But would it do so if the other side is ""worth it"" anyways? Or would it spread throughout the entire device like a liquid through a series of tubes, only being slowed down not stopped entirely by the resistive bridge?  


If it does flow only or primarily down the ""worse"" path because a seemingly terrible obstacle is all it can ""see"", the situation would remind me of the False Peak concept, which I primarily know from exposure to Ai Learning, or in the context of trying to find the highest point in a given map.

1685728362.0,How does a healthy human pancreas prevent low glucose?,"I have type 1 diabetes and manage my blood glucose with a CGM, pump, and insulin (Novorapid which is supposedly identical to human insulin).

Recently I have been using an APS (artificial pancreas system) which links my CGM and pump together to effectively emulate a healthy human pancreas. This APS system doesn't work perfectly and I often have high glucose after meals and occasionally low glucose (usually due to the absorption speed of meals or exercise).

I don't know any of the technical parts of how the pancreas does its job in managing glucose levels, but I have a good understanding of how to manage my own diabetes regardless. 

My main two questions would be:
1. How does the pancreas prevent (or at least reduce) sudden spikes in glucose after a meal?
2. How does insulin on board not affect healthy people (non diabetics) as much during exercise?

To add to the first question, as a T1 diabetic I need to inject (using a pump) a predetermined amount of insulin based on the total carbohydrates in a meal and this is a very rough estimate because absorption speeds can vary greatly. In a closed loop APS, the only way I've seen people prevent spikes (without knowing the carbs) is having insulin already on board but I don't understand how this would be possible in a healthy human body which isn't warned in advance about food.

To add to the second question, it is often too risky for me to exercise just after a meal because of all the insulin on board. The only method I can think of to reduce the risk of a hypo during exercise is to inject less insulin for the meal, but from the first question I either need to know this in advance or I need to be injecting small increments whenever I see a rise in glucose which would also result in hyperglycaemia.

I suppose I should also mention that CGMs measure glucose from the interstitial fluid, so trends are usually delayed by 10-15 minutes (although I'd assume the current glucose level can be extrapolated).
Also there are faster types of insulin available, such as Fiasp and Lyumjev, but I'd like to focus on why human insulin is still effective without needing these properties.

- Also, how much do specific skills matter? Is throwing skill, as one example, a crucial skill to learn at a young age?

- What is it like for an adult to attempt to learn sports skills for the first time?

I was reading up on iron's role in star death which got me curious about the energy release of fusion & fission reactions throughout the periodic table. It seems intuitive to me that a nuclear energy output equation would look something like this:  
\*energy output = (Mass of extra products converted to MeV) - (nuclear binding energy)\*

1684634210.0,"Why is the concept of time different in space, and how does it affect astronauts' bodies and minds?","Hello fellow science enthusiasts!  
  
I've recently been fascinated by the concept of time dilation, a fundamental part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's a mind-bending idea that time moves slower as you approach the speed of light or experience stronger gravity.  
  
Now, we know that astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are moving much faster than we are on Earth and experience a weaker gravitational pull. Over the course of their stay on the ISS, their clocks would tick slower relative to ours, but this effect is extremely tiny given the speeds and gravitational differences involved.  
  
My question is: what tangible effects, if any, does this difference in the passage of time have on the astronauts' bodies and minds? Does it affect their biological clocks, circadian rhythms, or even the rate at which they age?  
  
Also, on a psychological level, do astronauts report feeling any different in their perception of time? I've read reports of many astronauts experiencing what is known as the ""overview effect"", a cognitive shift in their understanding of life and reality when viewing the Earth from space. Could changes in the passage of time contribute to this phenomenon in any way?

So say you have two tiger cubs. Both the same size. You feed them each the same quantity of meat every day (progressively they both get more as they grow etc.) You feed them cows. But one gets 6 KG worth of Runt cow meat, and one gets 6 KG worth of cow meat from ONLY the biggest cows in the herd (but both the runt and big cow are the same age!) Is there an actual different between the quality of meat? And will one tiger grow up to be stronger/healthier because of the meat’s quality?

Again, maybe something in this example doesn’t make sense, sorry about that. 
An example with humans is that someone eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are small, and someone else eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are gigantic. But both bananas came from the same place and were the same age.

1684425151.0,Why do freshwater lakes & rivers seem to have less biological structure than oceans?,"I've recently learned to scuba dive, and naturally I've been looking up all the places I might be able to dive in the future, and asking experienced divers I know their thoughts about where the most interesting spots to dive with aquatic life are.

I've been surprised to find that freshwater lakes and rivers don't seem to have much in the way of macroscopic biological structures that create habitat, unlike oceans (which have corals, kelp forests, soft-bodied anemones, huge clam beds, seagrass meadows, etc). It also seems that freshwater animals stem from a severely restricted subset of overall aquatic life. Divers have been telling me that the only really interesting stuff to see in freshwater are wrecks. This is wild to me.

I spent a while trying to find out whether there were structurally complex biological underwater environments in the Great Lakes, thinking that massive lakes must surely support lots of interesting variety, but I'm not finding much variety in environments beyond scenes of greyish fish swimming around over relatively flat sediment or rocky bottoms.

I'm confused by this. I know that small ponds and bogs can be full of stuff like rushes and lily pads and duckweed and other things, so I'd expect to see that sort of environment grow larger and more varied with more space in lakes and rivers. With shallower waters (compared to the ocean) and a high ratio of edge-to-area where biomass from land can enter the water to provide nutrients or evolutionary access points, I'd have thought there would be an abundant variety of aquatic plant life, and that you'd see things like kelp forests or lily pad groves or lake-grass meadows; and I know freshwater hydras exist, so I'm surprised there aren't freshwater sessile cnidarians forming beds along lake bottoms. 

I've heard the mineral content of freshwater is too low for animals that form hard structures like corals, but there are plenty of soft-bodied structures in the ocean too that don't seem to have developed in freshwater. There are a few microbialites in places like Pavilion Lake, BC, but those seem to exist in lakes that are otherwise relatively low in biological activity.

It seems like if there's a conservation of energy, then sending all the mass out the back of the engine would yield the same thrust, as long as the exhaust can all be directed backwards.

So the diverging section makes sense, it allows the exhaust to expand and bounce off the walls of the nozzle, ending it directly backwards. And in an ideal situation the pressure at the exit of the nozzle is exactly ambient and all the exhaust is going directly backwards.

But wouldn't that happen anyways without the converging part?

I keep seeing people say that the converging part gets the velocity up to mach 1, and that chokes the nozzle. Does that mean that because the nozzle is choked the pressure inside the combustion chamber can get higher since the exhaust can't get out of the nozzle any faster, no matter how high the pressure is? And then because there's a higher pressure, more energy can be extracted from the pressure differential? If that's the case I don't understand how the higher pressure affects the downstream exhaust?

1683011973.0,"Question: Can cellulose fibers (Claire, 2023), be impregnated and coated with a metallic-matrix-infused polymer coating to increase conductivity and reduce flammability? (Additional details and Sources in the Post)","  

Hello,

I came across this article today (it was a busy weekend) and wanted some opinions on some thoughts inspired by it. The article is from Tyson (2023), which details an experiment that showed wood (altered) can be used to conduct electricity (Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023). Tran et al. 2023, imply (to me) that the outcome was essentially a cellulose product that can be impregnated with a polymer to help conduct electricity and likely reduce the flammability. However, if I understand (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019) correctly; given the assumption that if heat can be used to create energy (Chu,2018), the opposite is true; and if that is the case heat is likely to be a byproduct from electricity (assumption based on energy loss/entropy). 

So, my initial question is: 

If Tyson (2023) and Tran et al. (2023) allow for a cellulose material  (impregnated in a polymer) that improves conductivity (and likely reduces flammability), and some concerns are conductivity of cellulose and the flammability (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). An additional factor is an ability to create flame-retardant cellulose fibers better (Claire, 2023; Salmeia et al., 2016) and potentially combine them with the properties allocated (in this posting) to Tran et al., 2023. Primarily the impregnation and coating of the material with a polymer to increase conductivity and assumedly to reduce flammability (Chu, 2018; Salmeia et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023; Zhang et al., 2019). Could a layer of conductive metals, silver (Tran et al., 2023) or a silver and superalloy mixture (Sands, 2022; T. Smith, 2022; T. M. Smith et al., 2023); with an outer coating of the polymer that also incorporates a matrix structure (within the polymer) to facilitate conductivity better (Pan et al., 2022) comprised of the metals used, increase conductivity, and additively decrease flammability?

Additional Questions: Could the cellulose fibers (flame retardant) be created to include a matrix of metal fibers (second option) within its structure and be subsequently impregnated and further coated, as inquired about above?

   Thanks for any help or responses; I was trying to de-stress and grow (or correct my knowledge base). Have a Good Day!!

1683037842.0,Does 'pumped storage hydropower' qualify as a perpetual motion machine?,"Question provoked by New York Times article I read today showing that this form of hydropower is becoming more popular, but that's behind paywall so I wont share here. Here are two descriptions that are not behind paywall:

[https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage\_hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity)

I'm not in this field so take my description with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that for this type of power generation, water is used to generate electricity by gravity, similar to standard hydroelectric power (e.g. a dam), but in 'off hours', excess electricity is used to pump water up from a lower reservoir to an upper one. When more electricity is needed, that upper reservoir is used (gravity flow down to lower reservoir) to generate electricity. 

I must be missing something--to my mind, based on classical physics, this seems like it must be inefficient--how can we pump water uphill with electricity, then use that water flowing back downhill to generate more electricity than it took to pump it uphill? I must be missing something--perhaps there's always a secondary source of power churning in the background that is always available for electricity generation, so it's just excess electricity from this that is used to pump water uphill?

Every substance has spectral emission and absorption lines. We can use those to identify substances in and around objects in space, for example. However, these absorption and emission lines don’t correspond to the color of a substance if I were to look at it in a macroscopic amount. 

Like the spectral lines for indium make it appear indigo (hence the name) but in reality it is a silvery-white metal. Iodine (afaik) also has pretty weak violet lines in its spectra, but it appears that color in vapor form. This is odd to me because what a substance absorbs and reflects directly contributes to its color, and spectral lines (which describe that concept) seemingly don’t match up.

First year bio student, just curious about how there seem to be so many zoonotic diseases originating in birds that can spread to humans. There's also a lot originating from other mammals like bats and rats, but that makes sense since humans are relatively closely related to them, and have really similar body systems and tissues. But birds confuse me as a common source of zoonotic diseases. I understand that they're really effective vectors and spreaders of disease, since they can cover so much distance easily and poop often all over the place, but on a biological system level I don't really understand. Birds and humans haven't shared an ancestor since over 200 million years ago, and have significantly different digestive and respiratory systems.   


Rambling aside, what i'm asking is why are we so compatible with birds in terms of diseases? How do so many diseases infect both birds and humans equally as easily when we're so different? Why do some diseases affect birds and humans, but not other mammals? What do birds and humans have in common that other mammals don't?",0.66,5

If take B as a reference point, A should have a potential of 5V.

let's say I have a 2 ohm resistor connected between the positive terminal and A.

1680354286.0,Can cancer occur without genetic mutation?,"The Wikipedia article on [Causes of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_cancer) sums up the common wisdom thus: 

> **Cancer is caused** by [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation) changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and [tumor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm) formation. The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and [genomic instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_instability). 

I recently was doing some reading on non-mutagenic carcinogens, and came upon an article, [*Mechanisms of non-genotoxic carcinogens and importance of a weight of evidence approach*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383574209000428), which states very clearly, emphasis mine: 

>Non-genotoxic carcinogens are **substances that induce cancer** through  indirect stimulation of hyperplastic responses, **without altering DNA,  chromosome number or structure**. Non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide  variety of mechanisms of cancer induction including receptor-mediated  endocrine modulation, non-receptor mediated endocrine modulation, tumor  promoting, inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory  responses, immunosuppressants, or gap junction intercellular  communication 

There are many similar sources, but this one seems to state the point most explicitly. So, what's going on here? Has ""cancer"" simply been differently defined back in 2009 than it is now? Has the evidence been overturned that there is such a thing as a carcinogen without genotoxicity? Are they simply so rare as to be of no practical relevance and so knowledge never made it into public consciousness? Some other explanation?",0.89,4
1680157014.0,Is osmotic pressure involved in the circulation of ions through a cell membrane ?,"Hi,

I have a neurobiology course, and I have a doubt about something my teacher wrote in the syllabus of the course.

It  says that ions can circulate through the membrane of a neuron via  receptors, and that there is two major factors influencing the  circulation of ions : 1) an electrical force, due to the eletric  potential difference between the outside and the inside of the cell. 2) a  ""chemical force"" (sic) due to the difference in ions concentration,  ""also called osmotic force"".

I have 3 questions :

1. is the concept of ""chemical force"" a valid one ?
2. most  importantly, I'm note very qualified in chemistry, but it seems to me  that osmotic pressure is by definition related to the circulation of a  solvent through a semi-permeable membrane... here the ions are the  solute if I'm not wrong... so how can osmotic pressure have something to  do with this ?
3. the explanations of my teacher, are they ""okay"" simplification, or are they simply false ?

1680094701.0,"Can our body make an association between food and the circumstances in which we first had it, and can it process food differently based on this association?","I've been doing some work on personal trauma recently, and I'm curious about how the body responds to these sort of things. Food can often bring up a lot of memories (smell being a powerful sense, of course).

Specifically, I remember having porridge a lot for breakfast as a child - pretty robust breakfast I suppose, with carbs, fibre and some protein. I've not had it in a long time, but had it again more recently and felt I'd been hanging on to more weight than usual, when I look at the scales.

Given childhood, in my case, was often filled with a myriad of stress-inducing situations, including fast-paced mornings where breakfast was often eaten quickly, I wondered if there's any link between specific foods (more than just nutritional connections, like carbs, etc.) and the circumstances in which we first had it that might contribute to how we process foods, excluding potential factors like speed of eating (I understand that can affect these things also)?

Could the stressful situation of childhood breakfast times that perhaps triggers some evolutionary mechanism in my body that thinks it would be better to process certain foods in different ways?

I.e., body thinks something is in trouble in stressful situation, decides that circumstances might be difficult, decides to put food into fat storage for resources, situation repeats and food becomes associated with particular mode of processing.

This could be absolute nonsense, but I wondered if there might be any robust scientific literature on this based on my own limited understanding of ourselves, even if it disproves this. Given how complex our body is though, and the connections it can make between particular things related to trauma, it's a question that sounds interesting to explore.

I suppose it might be referred to as a psychosomatic connection - I've heard that term thrown around, but happy to be corrected on that.",0.81,4

1680038059.0,"Why are Euarchontoglires much more likely to be omnivores, to be small, and to be social than other mammals?","What I mean is I have a hypothesis.

Euarchontoglires were apparently originally obligate omnivores: that explain why some of them are great scavengers, and why they can tolerate MUCH MORE ethanol, caffeine and theobromine than almost all other animals. To be exact, all apes (such as gibbons and humans), rabbits, squirrels, murids (such as brownn rats and house mice), cricetids (such as hamsters), and caviids (such as Guinea pigs and capybaras) can all drink coffee, and eat chocolate, for many other animals, they are very toxic (just ask birds, squamates, felines, canids, and even equids). Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with carnivorous tendancies include mandrills, baboons, aye-ayes, and water rats. Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with herbivorous tendencies include gorillas, lemurs, and squirrels. Euarchontoglires that really are obligate omnivores include anatomically modern humans, chimpanzees (both common chimpanzees and bonobos formerly known as pygmy chimpanzees), pen-tailed treeshrews, hamsters, brown rats, and house mice. The only Euarchontoglires that are obligate carnivores I know are tarsiers, and the only Euarchontoglires I know that are obligate herbivores I know are caviids, beavers, and mole-rats.

Also, most Euarchontoglires are small: the world's largest extant Euarchontoglires species is either the anatomically modern human (*Homo sapiens*) (if we are talking about both height, and legspan), or the eastern gorilla (*Gorilla beringei*) (if we are talking about mass, volume, and armspan), or the tetraploid rodent (I forgot its scientific name, sorry) (if we are talking about genome size). If we include extinct species, there was a South American rodent that weighed 1,000 kilograms, or even more, and maybe *Gigantopithecus blacki* was 2.4-3.6 metres tall with a mass of 350-1,000 kilograms.

Finally, Euarchontoglires tend to be gregarious (such as rabbits, beavers, and gibbons), or alternatively prosocial (such as capybaras, brown rats, house mice, lemurs, gorillas, and chimpanzees), or even eusocial (such as mole-rats, and, in a sense, humans). Among the exceptions, there are orangutans (which are solitary in an on and off manner), and hamsters (which are obligate solitary). However, some Euarchontoglires are pacifists (such as bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, capybaras, and Guinea pigs), other are warriors (such as brown rats, house mice, baboons, mandrills, common chimpanzees, and humans) (I sometimes say that, in comparison to humans, orangutans are autistic empaths, and hamsters are schizophrenic sociopaths).

1679955367.0,Are there any extant nonmarine carnivorous flightless birds?,"I ask because I know that most extant birds (either flying or flightless) are omnivores.

I also know that the only two extant birds species that are obligate herbivores are the unique hoatzin and the strange kakapo, one is a poor flyer, the other is really flightless, but a great climber.

Formerly, there were nonmarine carnivorous flightless birds such as phorusrhacids (or terror birds, if you want), and the mysterious Jamaican caracara (these two examples are both australavians like the kakapo, but the former is related to seriamas, and the latter was technically the world's only flightless species from the order Falconiformes). Since they are all dead, the only living carnivorous birds are the famous penguins, and the critically endangered flightless cormorant. Both penguins and cormorants are marine obligate carnivores.

However, I think there still could be an extant nonmarine carnivorous flightless bird: the kagu (this species is exclusively found in New-Caledonia, which is part of the Fifth French Republic).",0.75,9

I do not believe there's some advanced lost civilisation, I do not believe in atlantians, I do not believe these sea people came and gave this technology to these people. I just don't understand how ~12k years ago we go from extremely simple building engineering, to Karaahan Tepe. The advancement to Göbekli Tepe a few k years later though makes total sense, you can see the gradual improvements they made from KT to GT, it's linear progress.  But KT appears to suddenly jump into existence, during the younger dryas at that. It just feels to me either I'm missing something deep, or perhaps there could be a chain of similar sites going back 15k, 20k, 30k, etc years (but even then I ask why did it take between ~250k years or ~40k years to figure out the early ones?).

Karahan Tepe, the older sister site of the world famous Göbekli Tepe, appears to be around 12,000 years old.

All of the evidence we have found so far suggests they were hunter gatherers who may have been doing small amounts of agriculture (which is backed up by genetic tracing of our modification of species, which happened over thousands of years). And on top of that did not have pottery.

Of course I've heard that this may imply that it may not have been agriculture that allowed us the time and requirements to build structures like this, but structures like this that allowed us to start agriculture. Or (what I would lean to) is that it was a slow mix of each pushing each other along.

But what I don't understand, is if humans were capable of this back then with essentially pre/minimal-agriculture, then why don't we see any further back?

Why weren't we building these structures 15,000 years ago. Or 30,000? Or 50,000? Or even 100,000?

I understand about the ice age (although some of the PPN sites seemed like they may have developed in the younger dryas, which makes even less sense?). But there were still warmer climates with humans in them.

Why did it take us ~250k years to suddenly figure this out, and then when we do figure it out, we're suddenly pretty damn good at it? Or even if you follow that humans only became behaviourally modem 70k years ago, again why did it take 60k years?

It just doesn't make much sense to me. Humans who could figure out how to make stone weapons, fire, primitive homes, etc, surely absolutely understood that you could chip away and grind away stone.

Is it possible we just haven't found these yet? And that there's just fewer due to lower population? It feels obvious to me that there must be some missing as there's such a jump to the PPN ones.

1679456139.0,Would the metastability of Tantalum-180m1 change anything about its physical properties if it were isolated?,"Tantalum-180m1 is the only primordial nuclear isomer, and is observationally stable, unlike its ground state which has a half life of about 8 hours.

According to Wikipedia, it has sufficient energy to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, and electron capture to 180Hf. However, no radioactivity from any decay mode of this nuclear isomer has ever been observed. Only a lower limit on its half-life of over 1015 years has been set, by observation. The very slow decay of 180mTa is attributed to its high spin (9 units) and the low spin of lower-lying states. Gamma or beta decay would require many units of angular momentum to be removed in a single step, so that the process would be very slow.

Compared to common Tantalum-181 which composes 99.98799% of natural Tantalum, 180mTa has a natural occurrence of 0.01201%.

It is thought to be created via photodisintegration of common Tantalum-181 causing neutron emission, so hypothetically more could be made by bombarding 181Ta with gamma rays. 

The closest thing to having a significant amount of 180mTa in one place right now would probably be in the Majorana Demonstrator, where 17.4 kilograms of pure Tantalum, including about 2.088 grams of 180mTa, are being observed in an effort to try to find the elusive decay of the isotope.

If 180mTa were extracted by isotope separation from 181Ta, would its metastability change anything about its properties? Unlike other nuclear isomers, appreciable amounts of it would be able to be created, separated, and gathered in one place without having to worry about it decaying into something else.

\*\*Just to be clear, I am NOT going to use any info I am given here to determine if I can bring it with me, I am continuing to research this, trying to get in contact with relevant authorities etc, and unless I have confirmation from said authorities I will not bring it. This post is just to help set my expectations in the meantime!\*\*

The medication in question is **dexamphetamine** (brand name Amfexa) which I take in the afternoons.

I know that Adderall is not allowed under any circumstances - and this contains **amphetamine** and **dextroamphetamine.**

**Lisdexamphetamine** on the other hand, *is* allowed, as long as you get a special permit (This is what I take in the mornings).

You can see the full list of controlled substances and their categories [here](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/dl_data/keitai/list.pdf) \- Amphetamine is listed as a ""stimulant"" and strictly prohibited, lisdexamphetamine is listed as ""stimulant raw materials"" and as I say allowed with a permit. They don't actually specify dextroamphetamine or dexamphetamine anywhere.

When I search dexamphetamine, many of the search results come back with dextroamphetamine and it often doesn't seem to differentiate between them, some people also call Amfexa the ""UK Adderall"" as they are very similar (although Adderall is not licensesd here in the UK either)

So I was just wondering, is there a fundamental difference in them, in the same way that there is with lisdexamphetamine (which as I say is permitted). I know lisdexa is slow release, and dexa is instant, and the ban is presumably to do with preventing abuse. But I thought this was the reason Adderall isn't licensed in the UK, whereas dexa is commonly prescribed by psychiatrists.

All I know so far oven-drying can at least prevent the sample from getting rotten due to moisture content though, not so much about whether it does reduce the phytochemicals when placed it under oven-drying. 

Also, if oven-drying does seem helpful. Is it a general rule to have it done in just days, coz I'm curious of having in a week but that might give erroneous result if I overdo it (not risking coz I'm being tight in time and budget for undergrad.)",0.63,1

2. The first ball hits the second ball, the second the third…(often explained with billard balls) If multiple balls are lifted at the start, it works the same, but two times directly after each other

1678571632.0,Can a chronic infection be annihilated if you strengthen the immune system?,"Say you got some chronic infections, like a parasite/bacteria/virus. It becomes active, then goes dormant again, and repeats. Maybe you don't notice symptoms but the immune system is battling it when it acts up, which likely causes colllateral damage. Let's say you now boost your immune system by healthy habits like exercising, cold showers, healthy food and whatnot. Is it possible for the immune system to fully eradicate a chronic infection because it is now 'capable' somehow of doing things that it previously couldn't? Maybe it detects the dormant guys when before it couldn't? Kinda like how a person with AIDS will catch infections easily, but in reverse.  

**EDIT**: So I feel like many people are misinterpreting a 'boosted' or 'stronger' immune system as one that recklessly attacks everything. That's not what I meant. Stronger refers to 'an increased ability to detect what is and what is not part of the body'. Chronic infections are allowed to exist because the body doesn't recognize that the infection is not supposed to be there. Making the system stronger is meant as saying, making the system being able to recognize these pathogens better, so they can be removed.",0.9,296

This might be a lot of information for one simple answer, so feel free to point me towards article or other papers that can explain it for a non-scientist like me.

Also, maybe you can give me a precise answer based on the context of my world. To be simple, there was Pangea, magic stuff happened, big war against Creator of the Universe, he/she/it decides to punish enemies by throwing them and their city in space, creating a new Mars-like (like red desert planet) satellite directly from the crust of the original Earth-like planet they lived on.

With the arrival of the Yamnaya culture, the first Proto Indo-European speakers arrived in Europe due to a western migration. As a result of this migration and the melting ice age, a good chunk of the WHG tribes moved north into the Scandanavian glaciers, hence the prevelance of blue eyes amongst Scandinavian peoples.

T Cells are a crucial part of immunity right? They can differentiate into memory cells.

In the book, it says that a T Cell's lifespan is 20-30 years so basically a 20-30 year old man can still have the same T Cells and antibodies from the immune response of the mandatory vaccine they took when they were babies.

1677990100.0,What’s the use of the equilibrium constant?,"When we were learning about the equilibrium constant, someone mentioned that it could just arbitrarily be changed by changing the values of the balanced equation. As an example, the equilibrium constant expression for the Haber process would be 

(([NH3]^(2))/([H2]^(3) x ([N2]) 

And assuming the concentration of ammonia is 1, hydrogen is 2, and nitrogen is 2, the equilibrium constant becomes 0.062. 

But since it’s just a stoichiometric relationship, the balanced equation 

2N2 + 6H2 —> 4NH3 

Is valid too. So therefore, the equilibrium constant expression could also be written as 

(([NH3]^(4))/([H2]^(6) x ([N2]^2)

Assuming the same concentration values as before, this would give us a value of 0.003. 

So what is the point of having this equilibrium constant expression if it can just be arbitrarily changed, even though the ratio of moles for each molecule is the same? Do we always need to reduce to the lowest ratio, or is any ratio fine? Which ratio is “acceptable” or “best practice?” Our teacher made none of this clear—even after asking him, so I’m still quite confused.",0.72,2

1677710060.0,"Why do cosmologists say that gravity should ""slow down"" the expansion of the universe?","As I understand it (with my PhD in astronomy, but not in cosmology specifically), cosmic expansion means that space-time itself is expanding. I get the whole ""inflating balloon"" analogy. OK.

I read things about how if the universe has > critical density then it will collapse (again). Or even if it's subcritical, then it should at least be slowing down in its expansion (were it not for dark energy driving faster expansion, that is).

The explanation I typically see for an expected slowing of the expansion is that gravity is an attractive force — it should pull stuff back together. Most explanations I read tend to end there.

But **why** would you expect gravity to arrest the expansion of the universe in the first place? The expansion is **not** a conventional explosion away from a center. It's **not the case** that other galaxies are flying away with some kinetic energy that is being transformed in to gravitational potential energy. Rather, expansion is an isotropic inflation, where everything gets further away from everything else as space-time expands.

If a particular galaxy were to get pulled by gravity in a way that would cause the universe to ""slow down"" its expansion, then would direction would that be? There is no center of the universe. The gravitational forces acting on any galaxy should be (on average) isotropic (but for some clusters and large-scale structure, but I don't think that's relevant to this question).

[Elon Musk plans 42,000 Starlink satellites](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-elon-musk-42000-starlink-satellites-earth-effects-stars-2020-10). With an operational lifespan of five years, after which they're de-orbited. We will have an average of 23 (42,000/(365*5)) satellites entering the Earth's atmosphere every day. 

[At 1,250 kg each (for the Starlink 2.0 satellites)](https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-deploy-starlink-satellites-pez-dispenser), that's 29 tons of satellites entering our atmosphere every day, much of that being aluminum. In other words, that will be almost 10,000 tons of aluminum effectively being aerosolized in our upper atmosphere every year.

Have there been any environmental impact studies of this?

Side note: For those who point out that we have two to three times more meteorites (by mass) entering our atmosphere than Starlink satellites, the meteorites are mostly silicates.

Also, unlike [geoengineering techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) to inject aerosols into our atmosphere to combat global warming, we will have no effective way of shutting off the rain of Starlink satellites.

I presume that the neutrino rest masses can be assumed to be negligible.

How is this energy split up between the three particles? Is there an even energy split between the muon neutrino and the W- boson?

My thoughts on this so far are such that the electron can not possibly have more momentum than the other two particles, but due to the colossal difference in mass, I presume that the neutrinos would take at least a reasonable proportion of the energy between them.

If a passing killer (CD8+) T cell examines this MHC I/peptide complex and determines that the bound peptide is of viral origin, it will kill the infected cell.

Assuming that the presentation of peptides on the cell surface is nonspecific and random, and thus could presumably include normal ""native"" proteins, how does the killer T cell ""know"" that a given MHC I-bound antigen is of pathogenic origin, thus triggering the response to kill the infected cell?  Any failure in this discriminatory process could lead to a devastating autoimmune response, I would think, so the cell must be able to tell ""self"" proteins from ""non-self"" proteins.

1591120666.0,Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

    * Two stellar mass black holes (36+5-4 and 29+/-4 M_sun) into a 62+/-4 M_sun black hole with 3.0+/-0.5 M_sun c^2 radiated away in gravitational waves. That's the equivalent energy of 5000 supernovae!
    * Peak luminosity of 3.6+0.5-0.4 x 10^56 erg/s, 200+30-20 M_sun c^2 / s. One supernova is roughly 10^51 ergs in total!
    * Distance of 410+160-180 megaparsecs (z = 0.09+0.03-0.04)
    * Final black hole spin α = 0.67+0.05-0.07
    * 5.1 sigma significance (S/N = 24)
    * Strain value of = 1.0 x 10^-21
    * Broad region in sky roughly in the area of the Magellanic clouds (but much farther away!)
    * Rates on stellar mass binary black hole mergers: 2-400 Gpc^-3 yr^-1
    * Limits on gravitons: Compton wavelength > 10^13 km, mass m < 1.2 x 10^-22 eV / c^2 (2.1 x 10^-58 kg!)

I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness.

There are lots of ways you could raise your temperature a little (or a lot if you’re not careful), such as showers, baths, hot tubs, steam rooms, saunas, etc... 

My understanding is that a fever helps fight infection by acting in two ways. The higher temperature inhibits the bug’s ability to reproduce in the body, and it also makes some cells in our immune system more effective at fighting the infection.

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

The image reveals the black hole at the centre of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun

I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact. 

My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).

The ""could we have waited"" in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean ""could"" in a narrow hypothetical (not, ""would it have been a good idea to wait"", which I highly doubt).",0.93,420

Are there (native or non-western) cultures that commonly fetishize body parts other than the western standard of vagina, penis, butt and breasts? If so, is clothing in any way related to this phenomenom?

**MOST IMPORTANTLY:**

If I was to do research on this topic myself, is there even any terminology for ""sexuality of a culture relating to clothes""?

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

1600254051.0,AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything!,"An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial ""aerial"" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.

Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.

Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/

We are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery. We will be available on Wednesday, 16 September, starting with 16:00 UTC, 18:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time), 12:00 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). Ask Us Anything!

1494160962.0,"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400°F, how is the earths core magnetic?","After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

Any thoughts?

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the response everybody!  This is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

Can someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics? Why or Why not?",0.93,204

1605465555.0,Why exactly are overweight people at higher risk when they get infected with COVID-19?,"I have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19. I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? 

&#x200B;

Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19. (It's just curiousity, I'll continue to follow social distancing and other rules in any case.)

Edit: Thanks for all the answers, I totally didn't expect the post to blow up. Now I have much to read, thanks to all people willing to explain. (And to some kind strangers for the awards). 

And huge respect to AskScience moderators for clearing all these ""because fat is bad"" useless and/or insulting answers, that I see in mobile notifications. 

And yes, I understand that being overweight or obese is unhealthy in general, no need to remind me about this. My question was about that particular case with covid-19. More detailed understanding of how it works, helps me to stay motivated. (The covid threat wasn't the main reason for my desire to lose weight, I have many other inner and outer reasons for that. It just happened that staying at home on lockdown helped me to start eating healthier and working out more regularly).",0.93,352

They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

Nowadays people are less physically active, and the rate of depression has been rising. Physical exercise is regularly advised as a remedy for depression and other mental health issues. Could it therefore be, that normal mental health requires a ""homeostatic"" amount of physical activity? Does sedentary lifestyle play a part in the grand scheme of more people becoming depressed?

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

I've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. But if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them? Or have we seen three-dimensional ""shadows"" of four-dimensional objects and I'm just unaware?",0.91,696

1560248895.0,Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?,"I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. The Moon**

>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite – Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
>  
>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

TIL: the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a [WWII German Ju87 Stuka Dive Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87). It was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

When a person gets really old,cancer cells would form in a certain part of his body since his DNA becomes ""weaker""as he got older ,but let's say just in this case that the cancer cells can not move to other parts of his body(Metastasis )to make the situation similar to plants where cancer cells are locked in this position since they have cell walls that surround the cells.

1647860461.0,"AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA!","Hi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!

Pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.

We studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.

Our study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755

A commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710

For less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/news-opinion/2022/march/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.embl.org/news/science/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).

Our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.

**Edit:** So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

* Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.

I'm in the Midwest right on the Mississippi and to say that its cold out is something of an understatement. I went for a quick walk by the river to see what all the hype was about (I'm from the West coast originally and I've never been in temps anywhere near this cold).

I was outside for all of twenty minutes as tightly and hotly bundled as a human can be and my eyelashes froze and I thought I'd freeze solid if I had to stay outside for an hour. I could hardly see where I was going while I was walking into the wind I had to keep blinking and wiping the ice away.

All the while I saw dozen of birds out flying around, in the few patches of river that hadn't frozen yet and flying in the air above. It was -20 give or take when I went out, and that's peanuts compared to what it was overnight, but these birds clearly survived that. How do they manage it? 

I guess for clarification, I'm talking about gulls, bald eagles and birds I am fairly certain were ducks.

1444488990.0,Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.

Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

I'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like ""if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?"" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a ""hide"" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?

It seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.

EDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in \*where\* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and ""why"" they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?

EDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. 

Precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you /u/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.

I didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a ""hiding"" behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. 

However, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt/rest cycle \~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to ""learn"" with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.

* It's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. Water can still be used. A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

After its scheduled Dec. 24, 2021, liftoff from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana (located in South America), Webb will embark on a 29-day journey to an orbit one million miles from Earth.

For two weeks, it will systematically deploy its sensitive instruments, heat shield, and iconic primary mirror. Hundreds of moving parts have to work perfectly - there are no second chances. Once the space telescope is ready for operations six months after launch, it will unfold the universe like we've never seen it before. With its infrared vision, JWST will be able to study the first stars, early galaxies, and even the atmospheres of planets outside of our own solar system. Thousands of people around the world have dedicated their careers to this endeavor, and some of us are here to answer your questions. We are:

Are these projects mostly done by people doing it for the first time?  Are they informed by past successes and failures somehow?

A lot of people are focusing on the 'subway' example, which was which first prompted my question, but apparently aren't as rare as I first thought.

The data, from the [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)](http://cms.web.cern.ch) Experiment, are now in the public domain under the CC0 waiver. The datasets include over 100 TB of data from proton collisions at 7 TeV, making up half the data collected by the CMS detector in 2011. The data are provided in the format that is used by CMS scientists for performing physics analyses. We have also provided 200 TB of simulated data (*Monte Carlo*) generated with the same software version that should be used to analyse the primary datasets. [Read more about the data release.](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/cms-releases-new-batch-research-data-lhc)

1588015220.0,Does gravity have a range or speed?,"So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is ""new gravity"" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?

I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

- Evenly distributed surface
- No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""Pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

Imagine you are walking to the bus stop. Your current position has a value of 1, the bus stop has a value of 0, and the distance between the two can be represented by a decimal. Before you reach the bus stop you must first reach half way to the bus stop (0.5), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.25), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.125) and so on and so on, I think you get the picture. If you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it?

I'm Kaeli Swift a behavioral ecologist specializing in crows and other corvids at the University of Washington.  Right now my work focuses on the foraging ecology of the *cutest* corvid, the Canda jay.  For the previous six years though, I studied the funeral behaviors of American crows. These studies involved trying to understand the adaptive motivations for why crows alarm call and gather near the bodies of deceased crows through both field techniques and non-lethal brain imaging techniques.  Along the way, I found some pretty surprising things out about how and when crows touch dead crows.  Let's just say sometimes they really put the crow in necrophilia! 

You can find coverage of my funeral work at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/science/crows-necrophilia.html), on the [Ologies](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ologies/e/56956025) podcast, and PBS's [Deep Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYVFZnNl6s).

Are the coronavirus spikes different enough from our innate enzymes that this risk is really low?

Am I missing something or is the difference so tiny we could never even measure it?

Edit: I am seeing a lot of people bring up drag and also say that the mass of the object cancels out when solving for the acceleration of the object. Let me add some assumptions to this question to get to what I’m really asking:
  
    1: Assume there is no drag
    2: By “fall faster” I mean the two object will meet quicker

I'm an emergency manager, doing disaster and emergency response for the past 25 years; I've worked at the local and state level, and served in FEMA for eight years as a Deputy Administrator. I've been a firefighter and EMT, and I know first-hand the importance of having the equipment and supplies you need, when you need it on the front lines of a crisis. Right now, I work with teams across the government - from the Department of Defense to the Department of Health and Human Services - to ensure our country has the supplies we need, not just now but into the future too.

It also usually happens in the middle of typing. It never happened, for me, on first letters I typed. And, I am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. When it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. It is always unexpected.

Edit2:
I can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones I am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. A lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings.

1423642542.0,The 'Infinite monkey theorem'. Is it true?,"The idea is that in an infinite amount of time, a monkey would type out the complete works of Shakespeare(it could be any book of course). 

I'm having a hard time of believing it to be true. I think I accept the premise  that given an infinite amount of time, anything that can happen, will happen. But I'm not sure if I think that a monkey typing out characters in a way that a book is written in is something that can happen. 

My argument is that because the way a monkey's brains work is not like some kind of randomness-machine, and that means you will not have every possible combination, you will tend to see patterns, even very vague patterns that are so vague and unordered that it will seem like randomness, but isn't really completely random. 

In other words I'm arguing that maybe (and it would be dumb to say that I'm sure of this) the possible character combinations for a monkey is actually limited, and not infinite. Which means even if the time is infinite, you will still not see character combinations outside the limit of what the monkey can write. 

**EDIT: Ok, so people have said to me that it's just a mathematical construct. Which means, it's not true: Monkeys can't write the complete works of Shakespeare in an inifnite amount of time.**

**What is true then is that something like a randomness machine, which is typing keys randomly at a typewriter, would eventually write any book that's ever existed, given enough time. Which is by the way not similar to monkeys at all, so don't tell me monkeys is a good metaphor for understanding this, it would be better to just drop the metaphor and used something that actually applies to a real scenario then.**

Ok, so I understand now, you don't have to tell me how confused I am any longer. I just think using monkeys is quite dumb to explaining something like this because it's so far from how it would have worked in real life, and that is my opinion, and both me and your mummy doesn't give a single shit about your disagreement with my subjective opinion.

I searched google and pubmed for literally 2 hrs to find the answer to my question, and I can't find any information.

I'm especially curious about mRNA vaccines. They get injected into the muscle, the cells there start translating the mRNA and spike protein gets exposed on the membrane and the immune system mounts an attack when then antigen is recognized and destroys those cells. (yes, the cells that display the spike protein are actually getting gobbled up, for anyone who didn't know)

Among the observations that scientists have been making, there is that such statistics does not show anomalies as thrombosis happens on an even higher frequency regardless. 

In Italy, two deaths are currently being investigated, and the autopsy did not confirm yet that either blood clots have played a role (a policeman and a soldier died of cardiac arrest days after vaccination though they didn't have known pre-existing conditions) or the vaccine did in other ways, or a third yet unknown condition. 

I am not obviously asking regarding the AZ vaccine specifically, nor the deaths in Europe. But since we expect illnesses and/or deaths to happen even in short time in a sufficiently big population, how would an autopsy *prove* a link with the vaccine? 

If other pre-conditions or visible diseases are found out, the physicians can rule out the vaccine's role. 

But had even (by assumption) the vaccine done the harm, the question is, how would the physicians find out during the autopsy? What sign would in some way demonstrate that? Beyond allergic reaction.

If you are in the USA, there is a 70-80% chance you have pyrethroid pesticide metabolites in your blood right now. If you have a can of bug spray, they are likely in it. If someone sprays for insects in your apartment or home, this is likely what they are spraying. If you are in an area where they fog for mosquitoes, this is what they are spraying. It is used in landscaping in public green spaces and businesses. These pesticides are everywhere - and for good reason. They are considered completely safe for adults.

And yet, multiple recent studies have shown that exposure to pyrethroid class pesticides during pregnancy, or even just having them used within a mile of your house, is a risk factor for autism and neurodevelopmental disorders in the unborn child.

In my research, published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, we exposed three separate cohorts of pregnant mice to a ""safe"" low dose of the pyrethroid deltamethrin during pregnancy and lactation, then we examined the offspring. All three cohorts of offspring had hyperactivity, reduced vocalizations, increased repetitive behaviors, failed basic learning tests, and had wide ranging disruptions in the dopamine system in the brain. All symptoms which, in humans, are related to autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.

3 x (33...) < 1
I recognize that the suffix ""repeating"" is referring to an infinite distinction, which would mean (presumably) the ""missing"" .1^nth percent will never be accounted for because of the nature of infinity.

Ask Us Anything!","[500 Women Scientists](http://500womenscientists.org/) is a grassroots organization started by four women who met in graduate school at CU Boulder and who maintained friendships and collaborations after jobs and life took them away from Boulder. Immediately following the November 2016 election, we published an open letter re-affirming our commitment to speak up for science and for women, minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA. Over 17,000 women from more than 100 countries have signed in support of 500 Women Scientists, pledging to build an inclusive scientific community dedicated to training a more diverse group of future leaders in science and to use the language of science to bridge divides and enhance global diplomacy.

500 Women Scientists works to build communities and foster real change that comes from [small groups, not large crowds](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-successful-movements-have-in-common). Our [Local Pods](https://500womenscientists.org/take-action/#pods) help create those deep roots through strong, personal relationships. Local Pods are where women scientists meet regularly, develop a support network, make strategic plans, and take action. Pods focus on issues that resonate in their communities, rooted in our mission and values.

With us today are six members of the group. They will be answering questions at different points throughout the day so please be patient with receiving answers.

1. Wendy Bohon (Dr_Wendy) - Hi, I'm Dr. Wendy Bohon! My research focuses on examining how the surface and near surface of the earth changes as the result of earthquakes. I also work on improving public education and perception of science, particularly seismology and earthquake hazards. I'm a woman, a scientist, a mother and a proud member of 500 Women Scientists!

2. Hi, I'm [Kelly Fleming](https://kellylfleming.com/), AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and co-leader of 500 Women Scientists. I firmly believe that for science to serve all of society, it must be accessible to diverse people - including underrepresented minorities, immigrants, women, and LGBTQIA people. Although I don't do research anymore, my Ph.D. is in chemical engineering from the University of Washington, where I studied reactions that help turn plant material into fuels. 

3. Tessa Hill - I am [Tessa Hill](http://hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com/), an oceanographer at UC Davis, based at [Bodega Marine Laboratory](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/).  I study impacts of climate change on the ocean, including ocean acidification, which is a chemical change occurring in the ocean due to our carbon dioxide emissions. I am excited to be working with 500 Women Scientists to encourage a diverse, inclusive and thriving scientific community.  You can find me on Twitter (@Tessa_M_Hill) and our lab Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/oceanbiogeochemistry

4. Monica Mugnier (MonicaMugnier) - Hi, I'm Dr. Monica Mugnier. I'm an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My lab studies how African trypanosomes, the parasites that cause African sleeping sickness, hide from our immune systems. You can read about our work in more detail at [www.mugnierlab.org](http://www.mugnierlab.org/). When I am not pondering parasites, I spend a lot of time thinking about how we can make the scientific community a more welcoming place for everyone. 

5. Kathleen Ritterbush - Hi, I'm Dr. Kathleen Ritterbush, Assistant Professor of paleontology at the University of Utah. My students and I study mass extinctions and ecosystem changes of sea animals from the time of the dinosaurs and earlier. I believe science careers should include all kinds of people, engage our communities, and support work-life balance.

6. Hi there, I'm a planetary volcanologist. I study the physics of volcanic processes on the Earth, the Moon, Venus, and Mars using combinations of satellite data, field work, and laboratory experiments.

Additionally, women are 50 to 75 percent more likely than men to experience an adverse drug reaction. ""

**So my question is, does transitioning with hormones (lets say a Transwoman/ Male to Female) have an effect on how the body reacts to medical treatment?** 

Also other interesting things I would like to know regarding that topic, are there differences in blood values between male and female, and how do transpeople get evaluated with that in mind.

I started clicking the links in the memo, and reading what the evidence they were citing actually said. It seemed like they were using those citations in bad faith-that the science actually said something other than what the state said the research says.
And so, I reached out to to the doctors whose work Florida was holding up as rationale for banning transgender medicine for minors. Ten doctors all told me that they didn't know Florida was citing their work - and that Florida is distorting their scientific work to push an anti-transgender (and anti-science) agenda.

Earlier this month, my colleagues at VICE News and I published an investigation of our findings, showing that this is part of a larger pattern of Gov. DeSantis's administration going to extreme ends - including lying to health care providers - to block transgender kids from getting the health care they need and deserve.

Lithification of marine sediments appears to be the most common process in the creation of sedimentary rock. It's quite easy to find information on this. However, I have found very little information on whether there are terrestrial processes that create sedimentary rock on land. One could assume that the relative absence of information means it doesn't happen, but I don't want to assume that just because I can't easily find the information means it doesn't happen. So, are there any types of sedimentary rock that form in terrestrial environments, and what are the processes? I have read about cements and conglomerates, are those typically the only ones?

Generally it seems that lithification happens in marine environments, the rock is then uplifted into the terrestrial environment, where it then erodes back to the sea.

1577651251.0,Can humans be taxonomically divided by subspecies?,"Now dont get me wrong, I'm no career scientist. But I've got a taxonomical/genetic hypothesis to foot, and I want to see if I'm mistaken or not. 

Assuming of course that a subspecies is, as defined, a ""a taxonomic category that ranks below species, usually a fairly permanent geographically isolated race""

((( Is it possible for the human race to be divided into taxonomical subspecies? )))

I know the human race is divided along many superficial physiological borders, between black and white and orthognathy and prognathy, etc., and that these features have little isolated bearing, as oftentimes they can appear in populations quite distant to one another; often to the dismay of phenotypists. However, there are many features unique to what used to be highly isolated populations. 

For example, the people who historically populated and continue to populate the Himalayas are known to have larger hemoglobin than most other cultural isolates, helping them dissolve and absorb oxygen more efficiently at higher altitudes. 

Furthermore, the peoples of Central Africa have a specialized susceptibility to Sickle-Celled Anaemia, which in turn reduces and in some cases even eliminates their risk of contracting malaria from mosquito vectors. 

Even the Germanic people of Northern Europe are in their own way specialized, having the most lactose tolerant individuals per capita in the world, thanks to their naturally developed capability to produce large quantities of the enzyme lactase. 

These populations standing as examples, I believe it is possible to divide the archaic cultural isolates (prior to today's heavily interconnected society) into human taxonomical subspecies, and I wanted to see the reddit science communities opinion on whether this was viable or not.

However, I once heard from somewhere that if you measure particle A's spin on X-axis, measuring particle B's spin on Y-axis will have the probability of 50/50 for either state, instead of going according the normal wavefunction.

So, what if we had, say, 1000 pairs of entangled particles, moved a great distance apart. At a defined moment, location A would either choose to measure the spin of the particles or not do so. After this, location B would measure the spins on the opposite axis. 

By doing this to many particles, location B should see 50/50 distribution if location A didn't measure their particles, or something else if they did, effectively receiving one bit of information.

Could it be done in this manner, or have I misunderstood something about the spin measurements and wavefunctions?",0.52,6

1363976827.0,Does new evidence point to Geocentrism?,"So, this is going to be my first reddit post, and hopefully you guys and gals can help me out.

The other day I heard a noise coming from my computer, it was the warning alert indicating that someone on the internet was wrong. I therefore engaged in a brief discussion with someone who advocates Geocentrism. Never having been exposed to this seriously outside of history classes about Galileo/Copernicus, and having a computer science background, I didn't feel well equipped to debate this strident person, who was apparently free of any doubt.

Still curious, however, I have since been trying to figure out what the consensus is on the data re:geocentrism.

As far as I could understand, he's stating that the [MM experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson-Morley_experiment), the [CMB data from WMAP and SSDS](http://magisterialfundies.blogspot.com/2012/09/newest-observational-evidence-shows.html), and just recently the [Planck data](http://magisterialfundies.blogspot.com/2013/03/copernican-principle-1532-2013-rip-why.html) all point to the Earth as being a privileged, non-relativistic frame.

I've checked out [Plait's response](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/14/geocentrism-seriously/#.UUycXhxwpOg) to some non-specific Geocentrist claims, and incedentally Delano's [friend's response to it](http://www.galileowaswrong.com/galileowaswrong/features/5.pdf).

I have also watched the 4 [extant videos created by CHL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wyRJZbNmC7U#!), as well as various wikipedia/rationalwiki pages etc...

But I was hoping for specific refutations of the things linked above, MMX and CMB information. I realize that this guy is a fundamentalist, and as such isn't susceptible to the kind of reason that sways me, but I would like to get a better grasp on the size and scope of his wrongness. 

**EDIT**

So, first of all, thanks to all those who took the time and effort to give responses to my original questions, many of them were very informative. As my first experience posting on askscience, and reddit in general, this has gone better than it could have.

Next; an apology.

I was originally thinking of posting these questions in one of the atheism, debate religion, or philosophy subs, but in the end I went with askScience because I figured there would be more experts in the relevant Astronomy/Astrophysics/Physics subjects here.

I arrived at these questions through my interactions with religious people on their blogs. I had never encounter a modern-day geocentrist before, and so was unwilling to continue discussing the points he made with the little information I had at my disposal at the time. Not having NdGT's, Kaku's, Hawking's or Plait's numbers on hand anymore, I thought I might try to get these questions answered here.

I then made the mistake of linking directly to that person's blog in my OP, which I am assuming is to blame for his incredibly quick arrival at this thread. I hope that the distinction is clear between my OP, looking for factual information about real data and theory, and the person who later made an appearance here. My training is as a computer scientist, and though I was contemplating copy-pastaing the blog-points which I eventually linked to, something about the unnecessary duplication of a wall o' text verbatim is nails/chalkboard to me. I realize now that there may have been unforeseen negatives to that decision, which would have made it worth while to spend the time.

I've noted the shocked tone of some of the original responses, followed by frustration and eventually dismissal. I personally feel that any and all questions are healthy and important to ask, so long as one is willing and capable of accepting the best answers provided by reason and evidence, so I sympathize.

Whether or not this thread eventually devolved into more noise than signal is obviously up to you to decide, but for my part I got some questions answered, and I suppose I got to eat some popcorn while an intellectual train wreck occurred in front of me.

I will attempt to collect a quick list of the information that I've learned as a result of this, and post it below.",0.54,47

The language of computers is in 1s and 0s, right? And so to correctly represent the universe, you'd need a mechanism which represents yes/no. The best I could come up with was elections which have a up or down spin with one representing 1, the other representing 0. However, in such a system, the amount of electrons would be insufficient to represent the information necessary to simulate our universe assuming that the 'real' universe is the size of our universe and has the same laws of physics/particles.

With only electron spin, though, you could store only the up or down spin of the electron in the simulation, so the best you could simulate is a universe with an equivalent amount of electrons, but only their spin all at once. Nothing about their location, velocity, size, charge.  

Then I realized that what I'm describing isn't really how the universe works. There's uncertainty. Einstein says that God Doesn't Play Dice, and the consensus I've always seen is that he's actually wrong about that.

As the fear of airborne illnesses has heightened, people have understandably become much more concerned about potentially contagious strangers and are choosing to go where high air quality standards are maintained. Conventional approaches have been focused on making filters tighter, but filter media can only be made so small before becoming difficult to move air effectively or efficiently. Reducing nanoparticles by agglomerating them into larger, aggregated clusters is the key. Larger particles are more easily mitigated and fall to the ground more quickly. [Atmofizer](https://atmofizer.com/) is leading 4th generation in air technology, with patented agglomeration tech using acoustic pressure waves to reduce airborne nanoscopic particles-without using filters and saving our landfills!

* An article by a chemistry Professor: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants)
* A podcast with a physician: [https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/coronacast/how-to-get-groceries-without-bringing-home-coronavirus/12134820](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/coronacast/how-to-get-groceries-without-bringing-home-coronavirus/12134820)
* And the Mayo Clinic: [https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus/](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus/)

Some claim it is indeed the most effective method.

The claim is that the virus has a lipid layer, and therefore soap or detergent will interfere with that layer and is therefore a highly effective way of destroying the virus.

However, I have not been able to find any actual research to back this claim.  

The only study I have found that tested this is here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext#sec1)

In that study, they compared several disinfectants, including hand soap.  Out of all tested, hand soap was the only disinfectant found to still have active virus after 5 minutes.  That is, it was the worst performer.

The CDC lists disinfectants believed to be effective against the virus, but not included in that list is detergent.  In their recommendations the suggest using detergent or soap followed by a disinfectant:

>If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html)

To be clear, I am not asking whether washing your hands with soap is effective, as I understand there is plenty of good evidence for this.  My understanding is that the mechanism of action is to physically remove the virus from your hands, rather than to inactivate it.  My question is about whether soap is an effective way of destroying the virus on surfaces as claimed in the above articles.

As I understand, the concept of spin is fundamental to quantum theories, so I want to understand how people came to its discovery and how the formalism was derived and defined.

&#x200B;

Being sceptical I also try to understand the history of the field concept. At first the field was just a background on which particles (as the atoms of matter/energy) acted, but only the particles were ""real"" (basically as the test subject of the field); so the field was an abstract concept, in the same way as ""spin"" is an abstract concept.

At which point was it decided that ""the field(s)"" is a real physical entity? 

&#x200B;

I understand that whatever error makes the formulation of a unified theory an impossible task, was made in the 1920s/1930s. It could be a simple thing like a translation error from German to English and back, it could be a logical/mathematical error in the definitions of the concepts. It could be the guilt of Dirac who ignored the discussions which led to the Copenhagen interpretation and just kept on working on a fundamentally wrong theory, but one which works almost perfectly.

And there's no out currently because everything works too well, nobody wants to give up the field. It reminds me of the switch from Geocentrism to Heliocentrism: Heliocentrism as a theory was worse back then, it took some time to iron out the problems.

According to a lot of current research, Plan B has been proven to have no post-fertilization effects specifically regarding an alteration of the endrometrium. However, I also happened upon a fairly recent article:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102184/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102184/)

That claims the following: ""The mechanism of action of LNG-EC is reviewed. The drug has no ability to alter sperm function at doses used *in vivo* and has limited ability to suppress ovulation. Our analysis estimates that the drug's ovulatory inhibition potential could prevent less than 15 percent of potential conceptions, thus making a pre-fertilization mechanism of action significantly less likely than previously thought. Luteal effects (such as decreased progesterone, altered glycodelin levels, and shortened luteal phase) present in the literature may suggest a pre-ovulatory induced post-fertilization drug effect.""

The evidence seems pretty compelling to point towards the fact that pre-fertilization effects of the drug are not the sole method of pregnancy prevention, or even the most common method. As someone who believes that life begins at conception, this is troubling for me. I took a Plan B thinking it would have no adverse affects on a potential embryo that had already formed in me, and then I experienced bleeding the next few days which made me want to research more into Plan B's potential to act as an abortifacient.

TL:DR: Research surrounding Plan B is highly contested, but articles such as the one above suggest that Plan B has post-fertilization effects. As someone who believes that life begins at conception this is troubling since many other sources are spreading the idea that Plan B poses no threat to an embryo. What are your thoughts on this?

1665115293.0,"Is the ""average"" human also the most attractive?","I've been thinking about this for awhile but I couldn't find many resources about it online. My reasoning is: every human has certain dimensions/proportions (let's say an IPD of 63-66mm); some of them are in the ""ideal"" range, whereas others are under (IPD=60mm) or over (IPD=71mm) it. However, if we took the average of all humans for each feature, the people who are over and people who are under would cancel out and the end result for average human (or maybe average male and average female separately) would fit all the ideal metrics. This is kind of similar reasoning to ""Wisdom of the Crowd"" (see: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)) phenomenon, but rather than a crowd's intellect, it's a crowd's (species') physical attractiveness.

One resource I did manage to find was this:

This is very nearly what I am going for, just couldn't find one for the entire earth. I am also not sure how accurate that website is.

This is my own home grown ""theory"" claiming that stuff *can* in fact go faster than the ""speed"" of light.

Let's say all sorts of planetary and star-like  bodies in this universe are moving all over the place. We are rotating around the sun, but for what it's worth our sun might be moving in relation to another body in space as well. Which in turn might have some sort of speed/direction in relation to another body in space. What if this would create a chain, which would eventually, theoretically, line up perfectly, and meet another chain that has lined up perfectly as well, but in the other ""direction"", meet each other at the ""fastest"" point of the chain? This ""speed"" of the chain would in this case be referenced to the first body which in this theory doesn't have a relevant motion.

The way this all works out in my head is that, theoretically, those two ""fastest"" bodies would have some sort of speed. (but both compared tho which reference point? Could you take just one of the two starting points?) And when they meet, would it's speed effectively be ""zero"" on one of the planets, and double the ""speed"" that both are moving on the other planet?

If so, then if the chain is long enough, why wouldn't they be able to reach a ""speed"" faster than light when they collide or closely pass each other?

In this entire story and theory, I just have to get back to the point that speed is a funny thing because of reference points etc. and you could totally say it's very relative. If it's relative then how can we claim light to be the fastest thing?

Also, how do we ""know"" it's the fastest thing? Is it just because we just don't know of anything that is faster?(which would be very stupid reasoning in my book) Or is there some solid math behind this?


On a related point, if galaxies are moving towards each other, these would have immense speed as well, but if light as the absolute highest speed, what would possibly be the thing that is limiting the speed of galaxies? and compared to *what*? What could possibly be limiting a huge galaxy that is floating in nothingness?",0.55,26
1334320940.0,"""Pre-baking marijuana before consumption increases potency"" - Is there any actual science to this?","I'm sorry, I know this question isn't as intellectually stimulating as most of the stuff posted here, but it's relevant to my interests. I ran several searches beforehand, but while there were a lot of pot-related questions, this didn't seem to be one of them. 

On this [forum ](http://buymarijuanaseeds.com/community/threads/pre-baking-marijuana.114442/)**(NSFW)**, and many others, there appears to be a school of thought that baking marijuana at relatively low temperatures - prior to smoking - activates more of the THC.

The reasoning boils down to this sentence: 

>In whole-plant cannabis, THC content is expressed as THCA (tetrahydrocannabolic acid) prior to decarboxylation into THC, which takes place when cannabis is heated during cooking, and smoked or vaporized ingestion. THCA is a mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory but does not have good affinity with our CB1 receptors...

While I'm familiar with marijuana vaporization, this seems to be something different. Traditionally vaporized pot is less potent afterwards, not more. Naturally, marijuana user forums are not known for the their rigorous citation, so I can't find any evidence aside from ""I tried it and it totally worked.""

He explained a theory that posited that the nutrinos were released at the speed of light a moment before everything else while everything else accelerated slowly within the star until reaching the surface and then accelerating to the speed of light. Thus giving the nutrinos a head start.


My question is this: was the basis for this theory that the cosmic speed limit of light speed must be true and so nutrinos must have come out earlier, or have we independently verified that they were released earlier than the other stuff?

I researched alot...

I come to the conclusion that a Photon has no mass. My ""Evidence"" was:

E²=(mc²)² + (pc)²          because m(restmass) = 0 

its E²=(pc)² or E= pc      

because E=gamma*m*c² and p = gamma*m*v its:

v=c      so if m hits 0 v becomes c. a photon defines the speed of light...

My teacher then said following:

1. A Photon has to own a mass because its influenced by gravity.
2. A Photon has mass because it has momentum (p=mv)
3. A Photon has mass on its flight but not when it hits something.. the mass (magicaly) dissapears as soon as it hits an object... 
My Questions to you poeple are:

1. Can i Use p=mv on a Photon or do i Use p=E/c? and why?
2. Are Photons influenced by gravity because of their mass or because of the bended space?
3. Can a Photon bend space? (does mass bend space or does Energy bend it?)
4. Is it possible for a Photon to own a mass on its flight? (and only on that.)
5. and how is it able to move with the speed of light when it owns a mass?

1484229786.0,"I know this is an topic, but how credible is this article on the effects of violent video games?","Title was mean to say ""I know this is an old topic"" my bad.

Article in question: http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2003/10/anderson.aspx

The statements that Dr. Craig Anderson make seem a little odd.

This for example: Myth 6. There are no studies linking violent video game play to serious aggression. 
Facts: High levels of violent video game exposure have been linked to delinquency, fighting at school and during free play periods, and violent criminal behavior (e.g., self-reported assault, robbery).

He doesn't really say if it's a huge reason why those acts happen or if its just a factor. Also it seems odd since last I checked there wasn't any epidemic of robberies and assault done in the name of video games. Or is it the same old, oh this person played violent video games and robbed someone/attacked someone, clearly the video games were on of the main reasons! I don't see my friends going around robbing people or attacking them. Sure some people do it, but isn't because its violent video games on top of being already mentally aggressive and having a troubled youth? Also the whole delinquency angle sounds strange to me, is there any merit to that claim outside of his own study?

Another statement he makes that I find odd: Myth 11. If violent video games cause increases in aggression, violent crime rates in the U.S. would be increasing instead of decreasing. 
Facts: Three assumptions must all be true for this myth to be valid: (a) exposure to violent media (including video games) is increasing; (b) youth violent crime rates are decreasing; (c) video game violence is the only (or the primary) factor contributing to societal violence. The first assumption is probably true. The second is not true, as reported by the 2001 Report of the Surgeon General on Youth Violence (Figure 2-7, p. 25). The third is clearly untrue. Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.

Pay attention to this ""Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this."" He stated that video games have been linked to robbery and assault, but says it is only a small factor now. It sounds like he was trying to make video games sound WAY worse than they really are. Also what annoys me about this whole article, is that it doesn't touch on the subject of do video games directly make people violent. As in if I don't have other risk factors or I have very few, could video games alone make me into a violent person?

Anyways thanks to whoever has read this, if you are a professional on this type of stuff I would really appreciate an answer/perspective. Thanks in advance!


Edit: Another claim he made in a testimony to the senate: Myth 2. Violent media have harmful effects only on a very small minority of people who use these media. One version of this myth is commonly generated by parents who allow their children to watch violent movies and play violent games. It generally sounds like this, ""My 12 year old son watches violent TV shows, goes to violent movies, and plays violent video games, and he's never killed anyone."" Of course, most people who consume high levels of violent media, adults or youth, do not end up in prison for violent crimes. Most smokers do not die of lung cancer, either. The more relevant question is whether many (or most) people become more angry, aggressive, and violent as a result of being exposed to high levels of media violence. Are they more likely to slap a child or spouse when provoked? Are they more likely to drive aggressively, and display ""road rage?"" Are they more likely to assault co-workers? The answer is a clear yes.

Where is the evidence for this clear yes? I never slapped a child or any of my family members. I never assaulted a co-worker. Only person I ever fought were bullies who harassed me. And I am pretty sure most people if they got bullied a lot would retaliate. Its not uncommon at all...",0.65,97

Free radical = species with unpaired electron. Are all free radicals electrically neutral (not positive nor negative?)

From what I can see, antioxidants are also free radicals. They give an unpaired electron to a free radical. After this, both species have no unpaired electrons. Would they both have a charge of +1 or -1 now?

This makes antioxidants 'good for you' because they result in the free radical now having no unpaired electron, and there are no more chain reactions that occur. I am also curious: when a free radical takes an electron from a different molecule, what makes this reaction 'dangerous' for the body?

1580073397.0,Why don’t we see clear evidence of seasonal changes in antiquity?,"  

I was recently considering the precessional cycle of the earth (25,920 years) and the fact that the seasons should swap at the half-way point.  Since the earth's tilt will be completely tilted in the opposite direction every \~13k years, we can expect summer to be in January in the northern hemisphere in the year 15,020 CE.  However, we should be able to see a continual shift in the date of the seasons as the earth's tilt precesses.  So, I was thinking:

&#x200B;

1. Half the precession of the equinox is \~13k years
2. 13k years to shift summer to winter (roughly 180 day      shift of the seasons)
3. 20% of this shift would be 36 days and should take 2600      years.
4. I think we should recognize a 36 day shift in the      seasons.

I tried to find some data on the summer harvest dates or seasonal changes, but I haven't found anything yet.  I found a reference in Robert Sallares book, ""The ecology of the ancient Greek world"", where on page 391 he says: "" A consensus has developed among ancient historians that the climate of Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE was virtually identical to the present-day climate.""

This would suggest that the precession of the earth’s axis has no effect on the seasons.  That doesn't make sense.  So, I was wondering anyone has any data or knows of any paper on this topic.

I don't think this question should only be discussed in other fields: conscious experience is a very real property of energy of certain distribution, that must be addressed by a true theory of everything. 

Through the limited perspective I have on physics right now, I see that scientists are trying to find a theory that explains every material process without taking consciousness into consideration. I think this is not the best approach: how can you explain **every** property of the proton without knowing its role in generating consciousness?

EDIT: I found a [much better description](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything_%28philosophy%29#Ways_forward) of the problem than my driveling above:

> In his 1996 book The Conscious Mind,[4] David Chalmers argues that a theory of everything must explain consciousness, that consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical, and that therefore a fundamental theory in physics would not be a theory of everything. A truly final theory, he argues, needs not just physical properties and laws, but phenomenal or protophenomenal properties and psychophysical laws explaining the relationship between physical processes and conscious experience. He concludes that ""[o]nce we have a fundamental theory of consciousness to accompany a fundamental theory in physics, we may truly have a theory of everything.""

But both creating significant amounts of antimatter and accelerating even a kg object to 99% of lightspeed or there about requires absolutely ridiculous amounts of power, power comparable to the energy released by the largest nuclear weapons in human history, or the amount of power the entire United States generates over days, even months.

Comparably, I think having amps as an SI unit is like having velocity as an SI unit and length being defined as velocity x time.

While me and some friends where discussing the 0/0 problem, we hit the question if the concept of Zero and Infinity exist on an cosmic scale in our universe. 

Here are two examples what I am meaning:

1.) Speed/Energy: As we all know the maximum speed possible in this universe is c, the speed of light, is it possible, that something contains more energy than an object moving at the speed of light?
Also does zero speed, the true stop of matter and consequential the absence of energy exist? I know it's impossible to reach Absolute Zero, so I guess the answer is no, but does a solid proof exist?

2.) Same question as above but let's look at matter instead of energy. Space starts to behave weird when too much matter is concentrated at one point, but is the singularity truly infinite? 
And final question, is the vast space complete empty (complete absence of matter) or could there be something we don't know of?

tl:dr: Can energy be infinite / is it possible that energy is complete absence? Same question with matter.

Thanks for your answers.

This seems odd to me because (1) this makes the outer pipe longer than the inner pipe, since they both follow the same line and (2) needs more complex arrangement of the magnets that curves the particles trajectory.

On one hand, it makes sense that you would just multiply the average attempts by the number of successes necessary.

If .99^100 = X and X is about .64, then you can just substitute X for number of attempts instead of probability and thus find the average number of attempts in order to have any given chance of success, correct?  That is, .99^x = .5, so x =68.9676.  This seems to assert that, after about 69 attempts, you would have a 50% chance of success.

However, as an interested layperson (my knowledge about evolutionary biology and genetics is mostly based on biology class back in school, and on reading popular science like Dawkins, Sagan, Bryson), my intuitive understanding of evolution and natural selection makes me believe that the *main* driving force behind the changes needed to keep evolution going is merely the *genetic variation* occuring ""naturally"" due to sexual reproduction, when the genes of two individuals are shuffeled and recombined. Sure, the occasional spontaneous mutation is needed as some sort of catalyst, speeding things up, and introducing radical changes that might turn out successful or not. But overall, mutations are by far not the main cause behind genetic modifications required for evolution - most of those are covered by standard genetic variation.

Now, I'm wondering: How accurate is that intuitive understanding of mine? Are there any numbers / estimates about how much influcence mutations have on the variety of the gene pool, as opposed to the variation already provided by sexual reproduction?

Is the theory of evolution even answerable by the scientific method??,"So correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means a scientist, but for a hypothesis to be true in the framework of science it has to be **Observable, Repeatable, and Explainable**, right? Well how does one test for the repeatable factor? It's certainly explainable, and in arguably observable, but no way is it repeatable (I don't think). WTF?

A friend of mine told me that for the theory of evolution, the legal method of determining truth is far more practical, in which the matter at debate is neither observable (unless there's a tape) or repeatable. So using the legal method, again correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a lawyer, the following factors are considered:

Was there a **motive**? (is there a reason)

Was there a window of **opportunity** for the accused? (is it possible)

Was there a **method**? (how could it have been done)

In regards to testimonies, are the sources **credible**?

In regards to testimonies, is there **corroborating evidence**?

So like, applying the legal method to Darwin's theory, the motive is the need for adaptation, the window of opportunity is over thousands of years, the method is biology, the credibility of the source can be up to debate, and I would argue that there is corroborating evidence, via historical studies such as the progress of change in a primate's skeletal structure over time.

I read somewhere that this relationship is obtained in the context of assuming that the electron's velocity distribution in a plasma is a temperature distribution. But this should apply to everyday situations, right? Like for example in justifying why Cooper pairs are unable to form at room temperature (because the bond energy is like 0.001 eV, which by the relationship above is about 11.6 K). But if a semiconductor has a bandgap of 2 eV, by the same relationship, you should expect that you need to heat it to like 24000 K in order for it to promote electrons to the conduction band. This is obviously not the case.

 I supported that evolution is the fact that random mutations occur to offsprings, which happen to be beneficial for the environment they live in, so they are more fit at surviving at that environment. Leading for easier reproduction for the individuals with that mutation, causing the mutation to prevail.  While the environment itself was not the cause of the mutation.

My professor said the the mutation occurred because of the external environment, and that they were not random. The example he gave me was that if a guy played the guitar from a young age, his fingers would get longer, so he would be more fit to play the guitar. So after a few generations, if his kids played the guitar also, they would create a family line with long fingers.

I'm not asking how light is observed or if planet A would observe planet B at 0.96c, i'm asking what is the physical location and velocity of the planets relative to each other.

&nbsp;

**Premise 2:**
Now let's say we are on Planet D, and we will use Planet D as the stationary reference point. Planets A and B start right beside us, Then suddenly both Planets shoot off in opposite directions at 0.75c each.

1 Year of Time has passed and now Planet A is exactly 0.75 LightYears of Distance away from us (Planet D)... and also Planet B is 0.75 LightYears in the opposite direction. correct???
So now Planet A and B are exactly 1.5 LightYears apart after 1 Year of Time???

&nbsp;

Now let's ignore Planet D and have a ride on planet A instead. After 1 Year of Time Planet B is now 1.5 LightYears away from us (Planet A), so surely that means Planet B was travelling at 1.5c relative to Planet A??? If they are 1.5 LightYears apart, then surely Planet B was truly travelling at a velocity of 1.5c relative to Planet A.... otherwise how would they be 1.5 LightYears apart.

So onto the title question again, if the Planets crashed into each other, then wouldn't Planet B impact Planet A at the true velocity of 1.5c and not 0.96c ??? Again I am not asking how Planet A observes the speed of light or observes Planet B. I am asking what the true velocity and physical location of the Planets are relative to each other. 

So if the answer is 0.96c, then doesn't that mean Premise 2 is incorrect and after 1 Year of time, A and B would be 0.96 Light years apart and not 1.5?

1413817885.0,Why do electrons have -1 charge and not a +1 charge?,"I'm currently studying chemistry and although I have done some further reading into some physics topics, I'm still confused as to why electrons were historically given  a -1 charge and protons a +1 charge?
Intuitively 'minus' something is a 'lack of' or 'debt' in something, but +/- electrical charges are just opposing charges, right? So I don't understand why, especially for chemical calculations and when visualising chemical mechanisms and such (where I was always taught to imagine the electrons moving and the protons being somewhat stationary, in diagrams), electrons weren't given a positive charge as I think electro-chemistry and understanding ions would be a lot easier to initially learn if that were the case. 
Is this something similar to the Pi/Tau argument (and ease of learning) or am I missing something fundamental?

I understand a lot of quarks/leptons, etc now have charges derived from electrons/protons/neutrons and it'd be a *huge* task to switch, but I'm just curious as to who or why electrons were first noted as being -1.",0.47,7
